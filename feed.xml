I thought just a little more, and only to recover a long-lasting misconception about Gauss Theorem Egregium which I was both shameful to admit for possessing so long and excited to have it cleared out of my mind.</p> <p>However, as I dive more into Needham’s method, I discovered a potential and simple failure mode, which naturally echoes another important statement: The Gauss-Bonnet Theorem. This deepens my grasp of the tension between <strong>local isometry</strong> (the peeling method, see below) and <strong>global topology</strong> (the area enclosed).</p> <p>Again, since this is the mumble series, I’ll not give all definitions and assume you have already known some flavor of the basics. Let’s begin.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="0-the-problem-confusion-setup">0] The Problem (Confusion) Setup</h2> <p>On Page 12-13, Tristan introduced a method to easily and intuitively construct geodesics on a curved surface (see figure [1.11] below). He claimed that “If a narrow strip surrounding a segment G of a geodesic is cut out of a surface and laid flat in the plane, then G becomes a segment of a straight line.” Well, he presented an intuitive proof (figure [1.12] below), but I’m immediately reminded of <strong>Gauss’ Theorem Egregium</strong> and there seemed to be something inconsistent (I’ll omit other information and count on you to look up the basics).</p> <p>I was thinking: the peeling is an (local) isometry without doubt, so geodesics have to be preserved. That’s why geodesics “peeled” off from the surface (the fruit/vegetable used in the illustration) has to be geodesics in Eucliean 2D space, which is straight according to the normal definitions. However, as I’m thinking a bit more deeply, the Gaussian curvature does change (before it’s nonzero, on 2D it’s zero, which contradicts Theorem Egregium), which leads to me to think backwards towards using this Theorem Egregium again. Immediately I realize that Gaussian theorem egregium is applied only to 2D surfaces (not to 1D curve since there’s no “Gaussian curvature” for a curve). Ah, shame to have blundered upon conceptual confusion. But treating this as an opportunity for an upgrade overhaul of my conceptual framework, let’s sort this out step by step and see what we might also dabble into.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/VDGF/VDGF_1.11.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/VDGF/VDGF_1.12.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Adapted from Fig [1.11] and [1.12] in <a class="citation" href="#VDGF">(Needham, 2021)</a>. </div> <h2 id="1-the-peeling-intuition">1] The “Peeling” Intuition</h2> <p>Let’s make it clear: in Figure [1.11] of Needham’s text, he introduces the following powerful intuitive tool:</p> <blockquote> <p>“If a narrow strip surrounding a segment $G$ of a geodesic is cut out of a surface and laid flat in the plane, then $G$ becomes a segment of a straight line.”</p> </blockquote> <p>At first glance, this indeed seems to challenge Gauss’s <strong>Theorema Egregium</strong>. Since Gaussian curvature (\(K\)) is an intrinsic invariant, how can a patch of a curved surface (\(K \neq 0\)) be laid flat (\(K = 0\)) without stretching or tearing?</p> <p>Well, the resolution lies in the <strong>limit</strong>. Gaussian curvature is a property of a 2D area. By taking a “narrow strip,” we are effectively reducing the 2D surface to a 1D curve and its immediate neighborhood. In the limit, as the width of the strip goes to zero, the “area” of the surface being considered goes to zero. In other words, the Gaussian curvature of the surface does not change because we aren’t flattening the whole surface; we are only flattening an “infinitesimally” narrow strip.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="2-geodesic-curvature-vs-gaussian-curvature">2] Geodesic Curvature vs. Gaussian Curvature</h2> <p>The Theorema Egregium applies to <strong>isometries</strong>. While we cannot map a patch of a sphere to a plane isometrically, we can map a curve and its first-order neighborhood to a plane isometrically (often called “developing” the strip; or just developable).</p> <p>We could think of it this way:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Surface: Has intrinsic curvature \(K\). The Strip: Because it is “infinitesimally narrow,” the Gaussian curvature doesn’t “<strong>trap</strong>” the strip. We aren’t forcing the 2D relationships across the strip to remain the same; we are only preserving the lengths along the geodesic \(G\).</p> </blockquote> <p>Consequently, the core of the questions (why such an intuition makes sense, beyond the simple proof shown in Fig.[1.12]) does not lie in Gauss’s Theorem, but in another concept: the geodesic curvature: The Theorema Egregium is about the surface (\(K\)), but the property of being a “straight line” is about Geodesic Curvature (\(\kappa_g\)):</p> <blockquote> <p>Gaussian Curvature (\(K\)) reflects the property of the surface. Geodesic Curvature (\(\kappa_g\)): A property of a curve relative to the surface. It measures how much the curve bends within the surface.</p> </blockquote> <p>The “straightness” of the peeled strip is governed by <strong>Geodesic Curvature ($\kappa_g$)</strong>, not Gaussian Curvature ($K$).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Gaussian Curvature ($K$):</strong> A property of the surface itself ($K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2$). It dictates whether a 2D patch can be flattened.</li> <li><strong>Geodesic Curvature ($\kappa_g$):</strong> A property of a curve <em>relative</em> to the surface. It measures how much the curve “veers” to the left or right within the surface.</li> </ul> <p>Recall that a geodesic is defined as a curve where $\kappa_g = 0$ everywhere (Will do a another blog on the computation of geodesics from the perspective of modern (Riemannian) manifold). Because $\kappa_g$ is an intrinsic property (it can be measured by flatlanders like intelligent ants living on the surface), it must be preserved under isometry.</p> <p>With this, we could demystify the underpinning logic of the peel:</p> <ol> <li>The act of peeling the strip is a local isometry along the curve.</li> <li>The $\kappa_g$ of the curve on the surface was 0 (by definition of a geodesic).</li> <li>Therefore, the $\kappa_g$ of the curve on the flat plane must also be 0 .</li> <li>In the Euclidean plane, a curve with zero curvature is a straight line.</li> </ol> <p>Notice that the 3rd step above relies on the fact that isometry preserves intrinsic properties and here the geodesic curvature, but again this is NOT Gauss Theorem Egregium (same fundamental fact but applied to different objects).</p> <p>Gaussian curvature is not defined for a 1D curve. A curve only has curvature (how much it bends in space) and geodesic curvature (how much it bends relative to the surface it’s on). By narrowing the strip until the 2D “surface” nature of the paper effectively vanishes, we are bypassing the restriction of the Theorema Egregium regarding the 2D area, while retaining the intrinsic measurement of the curve’s straightness. We are essentially “cheating” the theorem by reducing the 2D surface to a 1D line where the concept of Gaussian Curvature has no grip.</p> <p>The Theorem Egregium is a negative constraint (it tells us what we can’t do with a 2D patch), but the Geodesic Curvature ($\kappa_g$) is the positive proof. It yet emphasizes again that it’s important to separate the topological “budget” of the surface (the Gaussian Curvature) from the local behavior of the curve (the Geodesic Curvature).</p> <p>There’s only one last piece left to make the story rigorous.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="3-physical-approximation">3] Physical Approximation</h2> <p>Let me paraphrase again in another way. This narrow strip, in practice, since it cannot be infinitesimally narrow, by Theorem Egregium, <strong>CANNOT</strong> lie flat on the plane, but the more narrow we could get, the better aligned it is with respect to the plane. If it goes to limit, then Gaussian Theorem Egregium does not apply because this limit 1D curve is no longer constrained by this theorem.</p> <p>On the other hand, even in practice we assume that after peeling it “is” flat, this appeal to Theorem Egregium still does not “prove” the fact that once laid down the strip would become straight; we still need to assort to the preserved geodesic curvature, which is covered above.</p> <p>Now, back to the reality. In practice, a strip of finite width \(w\) cannot lie perfectly flat if \(K \neq 0\). The “error” or distortion required to flatten it is proportional to the area of the strip ($Area \approx Length \times w$). As $w \to 0$:</p> <ul> <li>The area vanishes.</li> <li>The constraint of the Theorema Egregium vanishes.</li> <li>The 1D “straightness” remains perfectly preserved.</li> </ul> <p>Another way to view Needham’s trick is that the strip isn’t just being “flattened”; it is being identified with the unrolled <strong>tangent developable</strong> of the geodesic. If we imagine a sequence of tangent planes along the geodesic, they form a “ribbon” that has zero Gaussian curvature (because it’s a developable surface, like a cylinder or a cone). Because this ribbon has \(K=0\), it can be laid perfectly flat in a plane without any distortion at all. Needham’s “narrow strip” is essentially a physical approximation of this developable ribbon.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="4-extension-of-the-original-trick-connection-to-gauss-bonnet">4] Extension of the original trick: Connection to Gauss-Bonnet</h2> <h3 id="41-failure-mode-of-a-strip-when-in-closed-loop">4.1] Failure mode of a strip when in closed loop</h3> <p>Now with the above puzzle cleared out, let’s think a little deeper into the next single, perhaps most natural topic: How about peeling off not just a single strip segment, but instead a strip which loops back into itself?</p> <p>Think about the physical reality of Needham’s experiment. If we cut a strip along a great circle (a closed geodesic) of a sphere:</p> <ul> <li>1] The Segment: If we cut just a small arc (say 30°), the strip is essentially a tiny rectangle. Because it’s so narrow, the “surface tension” of the sphere’s curvature isn’t strong enough to prevent us from pressing it flat.</li> <li>2] The Loop: If we try to cut the entire great circle, we get a “ring” or a “hoop.” On the sphere, this hoop has a specific circumference (\(C = 2\pi R\)).</li> <li>3] The Failure: If we try to lay that hoop perfectly flat on a table without stretching it, we’ll find it impossible. To lie flat in Euclidean space as a circle, the relationship between its radius and circumference must be \(C = 2\pi r\). But on the sphere, the “radius” (the distance from the pole to the equator) is an arc length. <strong>The geometry of the 2D area inside the hoop “locks” the hoop’s shape</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>Or maybe another perhaps more intuitive example —</p> <blockquote> <p>The “Paper Cone” Analogy:</p> </blockquote> <p>Think of a paper cone (like a party hat).</p> <ul> <li> <p>1] Local Flattening: You can cut a narrow strip from the cone running from the tip to the base. You can lay this strip flat on the table perfectly. In fact, you can lay any part of the cone flat.</p> </li> <li> <p>2] Global Failure: But if you try to flatten the <em>entire</em> cone at once, you can’t. You have to make a cut. When you flatten it, the cut edges don’t meet; there is a angular gap.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Yet perhaps another thought experiment:</p> <blockquote> <p>The “Train Track” Experiment</p> </blockquote> <p>Imagine the “narrow strip” as a set of flexible but straight train tracks.</p> <p>On the Sphere: You lay the tracks along the equator. They go all the way around and connect perfectly at the start.</p> <p>The “Peeling” (Transfer to Plane): Now you transfer these tracks to a flat Euclidean floor. Because the tracks are geodesics (straight), you must lay them down as a straight line on the floor. You keep laying them down, inch by inch.</p> <p>Now the Problem: On the floor, a straight line goes on forever. It never comes back to start.</p> <p>The Contradiction: To make the tracks close a loop on the floor, you would have to bend them (add Geodesic Curvature). But we know geodesics are straight!</p> <p>So, the “narrow strip” of a closed geodesic loop on a sphere becomes an infinite straight line on the plane. It loses its “loop-ness” entirely.</p> <p>Later we will make it clear that this “angular gap” is precisely what the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem calculates (\(\iint K dA\)). The curvature \(K\) inside the loop on the sphere is responsible for “turning” the geometry so that it closes. The flat plane (\(K=0\)) lacks this “turning power,” so the strip simply runs away in a straight line.</p> <p>But anyway, for now, in short: We can flatten a line because a line has no “inside.” We cannot flatten a closed loop without accounting for the gap (which is what we will show later as the holonomy, or “equivalently” integration of the Gaussian curvature of the area it encloses.)</p> <h3 id="42-the-formula-and-geodesic-loop">4.2] The formula and geodesic-loop</h3> <p>We resort to The Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, which almost fits in immediately, since it bridges the gap between the local straightness of the geodesic and the global curvature of the surface.</p> <p>Well, the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem is essentially a “budgeting” equation. It tells us exactly how much “straightness” we have to give up to account for the curvature of the surface. Let’s see if we could intuitively see its effect from the closed loop peeling failure.</p> <p>Let me state the theorem:</p> <p>For a simply connected region \(R\) bounded by a curve \(C\), the theorem states:</p> \[\iint_R K \, dA + \oint_C \kappa_g \, ds + \sum \alpha_i = 2\pi\] <p>\(K\) is the Gaussian curvature, \(\kappa_g\) is the geodesic curvature, \(\alpha_i\) are the exterior angles at any corners.</p> <p>Moreover, if we create a closed loop (like a triangle) using only geodesic segments, then $\kappa_g = 0$ along the edges by definition. The middle term of the equation vanishes, leaving a direct relationship between the “area-integral of curvature” and how much the geodesics had to “turn” at the corners to close the loop:</p> \[\iint_R K \, dA = 2\pi - \sum \alpha_i\] <p>Furthermore, if we use a smooth closed geodesic, there is no geodesic curvature (\(\kappa_g = 0\)) and also no corners (\(\sum \alpha_i = 0\)). The equation thus becomes:</p> \[\iint_R K \, dA = 2\pi\] <p>This tells us that for a smooth closed geodesic to exist, the total Gaussian curvature of the area it encloses must equal \(2\pi\) (the “angle” of a full circle). This is why you can have a closed geodesic on a sphere (\(K &gt; 0\)), but you can never have a simple closed geodesic on a flat plane (\(K=0\)) or a saddle (\(K&lt;0\))—the “curvature budget” doesn’t add up to \(2\pi\).</p> <h3 id="43-how-does-the-strip-fit-in">4.3] How does the “strip” fit in?</h3> <p>Now, imagine applying Needham’s “peeling” trick to each side of a geodesic triangle.</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li>On the surface: We would have three “straight” paths (geodesics) that enclose a region of curvature \(K\). Because of that \(K\), the interior angles sum to more than \(\pi\) (on a sphere).</li> <li><strong>The “Peeling” Conflict</strong>: If we tried to peel a “narrow strip” that followed the entire boundary of the triangle and lay it flat in one go, we would encounter a physical gap or an overlap where the ends meet.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>The Gauss-Bonnet Theorem effectively measures this “gap.” The amount of Gaussian curvature “trapped” inside the triangle is exactly equal to the “holonomy”—the amount a vector rotates when transported around that loop:</p> <h3 id="44-holonomy-parallel-transport-and-the-gap">4.4] Holonomy, Parallel Transport, and the “Gap”</h3> <p>There’s a simple and intuitive relationship between holonomy, parallel transport, and exterior angles.</p> <p>Let’s start with a simple thought experiment about parallel transport (you might have seen this everywhere):</p> <p>Imagine walking along a geodesic triangle on a sphere, carrying a spear (a vector) pointing straight ahead.</p> <ul> <li>Along the edge: Because you are on a geodesic, you never turn your “steering wheel.” The spear stays parallel to your path.</li> <li>At the corner: You stop and turn your body by an exterior angle (\(\alpha_i\)). You do not turn the spear; it still points where it was pointing.</li> <li>Back at the start: When you complete the loop, you compare the spear’s current direction to its starting direction. They won’t match. This net rotation of the vector after the full trip, the “error” in direction, is called the <strong>Holonomy (\(\Delta \theta\))</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>The above way of sliding a vector along a geodesic while keeping it “parallel” is called <strong>Parallel Transport</strong>.</p> <p>At the same time, just by some simple calculation we would know that for the total turn on a flat plane, our total change in heading (sum of exterior angles \(\sum \alpha_i\)) must be \(2\pi\) <em>to close a loop</em>. In other words, the holonomy \(\Delta \theta = 0\). However, on a curved surface, the amount we actually turned, the holonomy, is \(2\pi - \sum \alpha_i \neq 0\).</p> <p>Also notice that if we do parallel transport along the “peeled” flat strip, the vector remains parallel in the Euclidean sense because the strip is a straight line.</p> <p>However, when we close the loop,</p> <ul> <li>On the flat plane, the vector would return to its start pointing in the original direction.</li> <li>On the curved surface, the vector returns rotated by an angle \(\Delta \theta\).</li> </ul> <p>The theorem tells us that this holonomy $\Delta \theta$ is precisely the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the area we bypassed:</p> \[\Delta \theta = 2\pi - \sum\alpha_i = \iint_R K \, dA\] <p>Intuition Check: If you are on a flat plane, \(K=0\). Therefore, \(\iint K dA = 0\). This means \(0 = 2\pi - \sum \alpha_i\), or \(\sum \alpha_i = 2\pi\). This is just some high-school geometry rule that the exterior angles of any polygon sum to 360°. On a sphere, the curvature \(K\) “helps” us turn, so we don’t need as much “exterior angle” to close the loop.</p> <p>Consequently, if we apply Needham’s trick, i.e., peel off the strip of geodesic loop, we would find that</p> <blockquote> <p>While we can peel a <strong>single</strong> geodesic segment and lay it <strong>flat</strong> perfectly, we <strong>cannot</strong> peel a <strong>closed loop</strong> of geodesics and lay the resulting “frame” flat in the plane without a gap or overlap.</p> </blockquote> <p>The “angle” of that gap is the <strong>holonomy</strong>. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem tells us that this gap is exactly equal to the total Gaussian curvature “trapped” inside the area we just cut out.</p> <ul> <li><strong>On a Sphere ($K&gt;0$):</strong> The geodesics turn “toward” each other, and the interior angles sum to $&gt;\pi$.</li> <li><strong>On a Saddle ($K&lt;0$):</strong> The geodesics flare “away” from each other, and the interior angles sum to $&lt;\pi$.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Needham’s trick works because a 1D line has no “area” to trap curvature. The “straightness” we see on the paper is the physical manifestation of zero geodesic curvature, an intrinsic property that survives the transition from the fruit’s skin to the flat desk.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Brain-Computer Interface"/><category term="Manifold"/><category term="Differential Geometry"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Geodescis and its construction, Egregium, Gauss-Bonnet and Chern]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">BCI nitty-gritty (1): Equivalence (or Lack Thereof) between Block-wise and Global Z-Scoring</title><link href="https://jasmineruixiang.github.io/blog/2026/zscore/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BCI nitty-gritty (1): Equivalence (or Lack Thereof) between Block-wise and Global Z-Scoring"/><published>2026-02-06T11:16:09+00:00</published><updated>2026-02-06T11:16:09+00:00</updated><id>https://jasmineruixiang.github.io/blog/2026/zscore</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jasmineruixiang.github.io/blog/2026/zscore/"><![CDATA[<p>This short blog provides a detailed, self-contained computational analysis of whether two z-scoring procedures applied to block-structured neural data are equivalent, and if different how.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="1-problem-setup">1] Problem setup</h2> <p>Let’s say that we have neural data organized into blocks:</p> <ul> <li>Number of blocks: \(B\)</li> <li>Each block has data matrix in shape: \((x_{i, j}^b) \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times n}, \quad b = 1, \dots, B\)</li> <li>\(t\) = number of time points (samples)</li> <li>\(n\) = number of neural features</li> </ul> <p>Z-scoring is performed <strong>feature-wise</strong>, so all derivations below consider <strong>one fixed feature</strong> (column) at a time.

Today we will be exploring more on tangent vectors, and another key concept related to tangent spaces for different tangent planes: connections.</p> <h2 id="intuition-directional-derivatives">Intuition: Directional Derivatives</h2> <p>🌐 The Connection: Bridging Derivatives from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to Curved Manifolds The concept of a connection is the necessary tool that allows us to perform differential calculus on curved spaces (manifolds), such as the surface of a sphere. It generalizes the familiar idea of the directional derivative from flat Euclidean space ($\mathbb{R}^3$).</p> <ol> <li>Directional Derivatives in Euclidean Space ($\mathbb{R}^3$) In $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$, the directional derivative provides a simple way to measure change. The basis vectors $\left{ \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k} \right}$ (or the equivalent operators $\left{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right}$) are constant, allowing us to define derivatives simply as component-wise partial derivatives. Let $p=(1, 2, 0)$ be a point, $X=(y, -x, 3x)$ be the direction vector field, and $V=(xz, y^2, -2x)$ be a vector field. A. Derivative of a Scalar Function ($D_X f$) This is the directional derivative of a smooth scalar function $f$ in the direction $X$.</li> </ol> <p>Perspective Formula Example Result for f(x,y,z)=xy2+z at p Vector-Based (Calculus) $D_X f = \nabla f \cdot X$ $D_X f(p) = \langle 4, 4, 1 \rangle \cdot \langle 2, -1, 3 \rangle = \mathbf{7}$ Point Derivation (Geometry) $X[f] = X^i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}$ $Xf = (y^3 - 2x^2y + 3x)\big</p> <p>This confirms that in differential geometry, a tangent vector $X$ is rigorously defined as a point derivation—an operator that mimics the directional derivative by satisfying the Leibniz rule. B. Derivative of a Vector Field ($D_X V$) This derivative measures how the vector field $V$ changes as we move in the direction $X$. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, this is calculated by taking the directional derivative of each component of $V$. Using the vector fields $X$ and $V$: The $k$-th component of the resulting vector $D_X V$ is $(D_X V)^k = \sum_{i} X^i \frac{\partial V^k}{\partial x^i}$. Component 1 (i.e., $k=1$): $(D_X V)^1 = yz + 3x^2$ Component 2 (i.e., $k=2$): $(D_X V)^2 = -2xy$ Component 3 (i.e., $k=3$): $(D_X V)^3 = -2y$ Evaluating at $p=(1, 2, 0)$ gives:</p> <p>\(D_X V(p) = \langle 3, -4, -4 \rangle\)</p> <ol> <li>The General Connection: The Covariant Derivative ($\nabla_X V$) The formula for $D_X V$ fails on a curved manifold $M$ because the tangent spaces $T_p M$ and $T_q M$ at nearby points $p$ and $q$ are distinct. We cannot simply subtract the vector $V(p)$ from $V(q)$. A Connection ($\nabla$) is the rule that provides the necessary “correction” to define the derivative intrinsically on $M$. The resulting derivative is called the covariant derivative $\nabla_X V$. A. Definition and Axioms The connection is an operator $\nabla: C^{\infty}(M) \times C^{\infty}(M) \to C^{\infty}(M)$ that maps two vector fields, $X$ and $V$, to a new vector field $\nabla_X V$, satisfying: Linearity over Functions in $X$: $\nabla_{fX} V = f \nabla_X V$ Linearity in $V$: $\nabla_X (aV + bW) = a \nabla_X V + b \nabla_X W$ Leibniz Rule: $\nabla_X (fV) = (Xf) V + f \nabla_X V$ (where $Xf$ is the directional derivative of $f$) B. The Coordinate Form and Christoffel Symbols In local coordinates, the covariant derivative $\nabla_X V$ is defined using the Christoffel symbols ($\Gamma^k_{ij}$), which represent the rate of change of the coordinate basis vectors $\left{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right}$:</li> </ol> <p>\((\nabla_X V)^k = \underbrace{X^i \frac{\partial V^k}{\partial x^i}}_{\text{I. Flat-Space Derivative Term}} + \underbrace{X^i \Gamma^k_{ij} V^j}_{\text{II. Curvature Correction Term}}\) The Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are defined by the action of the connection on the basis vectors:</p> <p>\(\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} = \sum_{k} \Gamma^k_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}\) Difference from Euclidean Case: In $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Cartesian coordinates, $\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$, and the second term vanishes, resulting in $\nabla_X V = D_X V$. On a curved manifold, $\Gamma^k_{ij} \neq 0$, and the correction term is essential.</p> <ol> <li>The Levi-Civita Connection In Riemannian Geometry, a Riemannian metric $g$ is introduced to measure lengths and angles. The Levi-Civita Connection is the unique connection that respects this metric structure. It is defined by two crucial properties: Metric Compatibility: The connection must preserve the metric $g$ under parallel transport.</li> </ol> <p>\(X(g(V, W)) = g(\nabla_X V, W) + g(V, \nabla_X W)\) Zero Torsion: The connection must satisfy:</p> \[\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X = [X, Y]\] <p>where $[X, Y]$ is the Lie bracket. The Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita Connection are thus entirely determined by the components of the metric $g_{ij}$ and their first derivatives:</p> \[\Gamma^k_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} g^{k\ell} \left( \frac{\partial g_{j\ell}}{\partial x^i} + \frac{\partial g_{i\ell}}{\partial x^j} - \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^\ell} \right)\] <h2 id="connections">Connections</h2> <h2 id="christoffel-symbols">Christoffel Symbols</h2> <h2 id="levi-civita-connections">Levi-Civita Connections</h2>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Differential Geometry"/><category term="Geometry Concepts/Tools"/><category term="Topology Concepts/Tools"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploration of Connection]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Manifold and Riemannian Geometry (3): Immersion, Submersion and Embedding (in progress)</title><link href="https://jasmineruixiang.github.io/blog/2026/Manifold(3)/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Manifold and Riemannian Geometry (3): Immersion, Submersion and Embedding (in progress)"/><published>2026-01-14T20:22:25+00:00</published><updated>2026-01-14T20:22:25+00:00</updated><id>https://jasmineruixiang.github.io/blog/2026/Manifold(3)</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jasmineruixiang.github.io/blog/2026/Manifold(3)/"><![CDATA[<p>This is episode 3 on the smooth manifold series.

It controls <em>points</em>, but says nothing about what happens to <em>directions</em>. Crucially, differentiability of the inverse is <em>not</em> assumed.</p> <p>Fine, but then why injectivity of the differential is not automatically assured? Notice that the differential</p> \[dX_p : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3\] <p>being injective means it has <strong>rank 2</strong> meaning no tangent direction is collapsed. A map can be:</p> <ul> <li>injective,</li> <li>continuous with continuous inverse,</li> <li>differentiable,</li> </ul> <p>and <em>still</em> have rank drop somewhere. Let me give a concrete example:</p> <p>Consider \(X(u,v) = (u^3, v, 0).\)</p> <p>Properties of this map:</p> <ul> <li>It is <strong>injective</strong></li> <li>It is a <strong>homeomorphism onto its image</strong></li> <li>It is differentiable everywhere</li> </ul> <p>However, its differential is \(dX_{(u,v)} = \begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 &amp; 0 \ 0 &amp; 1 \ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\)</p> <p>At \($u = 0\), this matrix has <strong>rank 1</strong>, not 2. One tangent direction is squashed. Therefore, this map is <strong>not an immersion</strong>, and it does <strong>not</strong> define a regular surface in do Carmo’s sense.</p> <hr/> <p>However, you might observe here a seemingly apparent paradox: “But the image is <strong>Just</strong> a plane!”</p> <p>Well, the image of \(X(u,v) = (u^3, v, 0)\) is \({(x,y,0) : x,y \in \mathbb{R}},\) which is the entire (xy)-plane indeed. As a <strong>subset</strong> of \(\mathbb{R}^3\), this plane is perfectly flat, so one might expect its tangent plane at every point to be the whole plane. So then why does the tangent collapse under this map?</p> <hr/> <p>The key point here is that here are <strong>two distinct notions</strong> at play:</p> <ol> <li>The tangent plane of a <strong>subset</strong> of \(\mathbb{R}^3\)</li> <li>The tangent plane <strong>defined by a parametrization</strong></li> </ol> <p>In do Carmo’s approach, tangent planes are defined <em>via parametrizations</em>. The tangent plane at a point is \(T_pS = \operatorname{span}{X_u(p), X_v(p)}.\)</p> <p>For the map above: \(X_u = (3u^2, 0, 0), \quad X_v = (0,1,0).\)</p> <p>At (u=0): \(X_u(0,v) = (0,0,0), \quad X_v(0,v) = (0,1,0),\) so the span is <strong>1‑dimensional</strong>.</p> <p>This means:</p> <blockquote> <p>The parametrization fails to distinguish two independent directions in the parameter domain.</p> </blockquote> <p>Geometrically, the $u$-direction has been crushed.</p> <hr/> <p>But does the plane still have a 2D tangent plane?</p> <p>Yes — but <strong>not via this parametrization</strong>.</p> <p>If instead we parametrize the same plane by \(Y(s,t) = (s,t,0),\) then \(dY = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \ 0 &amp; 1 \ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix},\) which has rank 2 everywhere.</p> <p>So the <em>same subset</em> becomes a <strong>regular surface</strong> under a different map.</p> <hr/> <p>Finally, what does this meana conceptually? The key lesson is:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Regularity is not a property of the subset alone — it is a property of the subset together with its smooth structure.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Different parametrizations can induce:</p> <ul> <li>a <strong>good</strong> smooth structure (immersion)</li> <li>or a <strong>bad</strong> one (rank collapse)</li> </ul> <p>This is why do Carmo requires that <strong>there exists</strong> a local parametrization with injective differential.</p> <hr/> <p>In other words, if you ask “Does that mean there might exist other maps which make the plane a regular surface?”, then the answer is Yes — absolutely. The plane <em>is</em> a regular surface because such maps exist.</p> <p>Behind that is another question: “Does immersion entirely depend on which maps we pick?” Yes!</p> <ul> <li><strong>Immersion is a property of the map</strong>, not of the set.</li> <li>A <strong>regular surface</strong> is a set for which <em>good immersions exist everywhere</em>.</li> </ul> <p>In this seense, do Carmo does separate the conditions, being deliberately modular:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Homeomorphism</strong> → good topology (no self‑intersections)</li> <li><strong>Injective differential</strong> → good differential geometry</li> </ol> <p>whether neither condition implies the other.</p> <p>Finally, some of key points:</p> <ul> <li>The same subset of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) can support <strong>many different smooth structures</strong></li> <li>Differential geometry only works once a smooth structure is fixed</li> <li>Parametrizations are how do Carmo <em>builds</em> that structure</li> </ul> <p>This is why modern texts often say:</p> <blockquote> <p>“A surface is a 2‑dimensional smooth manifold embedded in $$\mathbb{R}^3$.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Do Carmo reaches this notion <strong>from parametrizations upward</strong>, rather than assuming it at the start.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p><strong>Topology sees points.</strong> <strong>Differential geometry sees directions.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>A homeomorphism controls points.

Indeed,</p> <h2 id="1-three-equivalent-definitions-of-tangent-space">1] Three equivalent definitions of Tangent Space</h2> <p>We’ll cover three equivalent definitions tangent space.</p> <h3 id="1-tangent-vectors-are-equivalence-classes-of-curves">[1] Tangent vectors are equivalence classes of curves</h3> <p>The definiton of homeomorphism and charts allow us to pull functional analysis from \(C^{\infty}(M)\) or \(C^{\infty}(M, N)\) on \(M\) into \(\mathbb{R^n}\) itself and thus we could proceed with techqniues built within the Euclidean space. Later when defining tangent/cotangent space from the geometric standpoint, we will see another side of the same story.</p> <p>tangent vectors are equivalence classes of smooth curves through \(p\):</p> \[T_pM = \{\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t = 0} \gamma(t) \Big| \gamma: (\epsilon, \epsilon) \rightarrow M, \; \gamma(0) = p \}\] <p>where \(\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2\) if in some (equivalently, any) coordinate chart \(\phi: U \subset M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\):</p> \[\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t = 0} \phi(\gamma_1(t)) = \frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t = 0} \phi(\gamma_2(t))\] <p>Consequently, each tangent vector is represented by the velocity of a curve through \(p\).</p> <h3 id="2-tangent-vectors-are-derivations-at-p">[2] Tangent vectors are derivations at \(p\)</h3> <p>Let \(M\) be a manifold, the tangent space at \(p \in M\), denoted as \(T_pM\), is the the vector space of all derivations at \(p\).

This should make it very clear that we are treating the tangent vectors as actually “vectors” living in $\mathbb{R}^3$ like how we usually refer them to be. With this extrinsic embedding, the general form of a vector field coincides with the intrinsic notion, but more tangible:</p> <p>$X = a(\theta, \phi)\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + b(\theta, \phi)\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}$,</p> <p>then as a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$: $X_p = a \frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta} + b\frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi}$, and</p> <p>$X_p(f) = \nabla \tilde{f}(p) \cdot X_p$</p> <p>Notice that for this computation no coordinate pullback is required. But to be crystal clear, we do <strong>not</strong> compute the vector field “without coordinates”. We simply You replaced intrinsic coordinates on $\mathbb{S}^2$ by ambient Cartesian coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^3$. So coordinates are still there — just in a different space.</p> <hr/> <p>Before we continue, let’s dwell on this formula for a while:</p> \[\boxed{ X_p(f) = \nabla \tilde f(p) \cdot X_p }\] <p>This identity guarantees consistency between 1] the derivation definition and 2] the embedded vector representation (Question: is this just chain rule?s). It explains why the extrinsic calculation agrees with the intrinsic definition. If we have a nice embedding, two views are nice. However, if we go to the general abstract case without the ambient space, we could only assort to the intrinsic definition.</p> <hr/> <p>To be rigorous, you may be concerned about the specific use of the function extension here. However, we could show that extensions do not matter, because <strong>“tangent vectors annihilate normal components”</strong>. Let me explain below:</p> <p>If \(g : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfies \(g|_{S^2} = 0,\) then for all \(v \in T_p S^2\), \(v(g) = 0.\) Equivalently, \(\nabla g(p) \perp T_p\mathbb{S}^2\)</p> <hr/> <h3 id="proof-via-curves">Proof (via curves):</h3> <p>Let \(\gamma(t) \subset S^2\) with \(\gamma(0)=p, \quad \gamma'(0)=v.\)</p> <p>Since \(g(\gamma(t)) = 0\) for all \(t\), \(v(g) = \frac{d}{dt} g(\gamma(t))\big|_{t=0} = 0.\)</p> <hr/> <h3 id="concrete-example">Concrete example</h3> <p>Let \(g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1.\)</p> <p>Then: \(\nabla g = (2x,2y,2z)\) which is normal to \(S^2\).</p> <p>For any tangent vector \(v\), \(v(g) = \nabla g \cdot v = 0.\)</p> <hr/> <h3 id="consequence-crucial">Consequence (crucial)</h3> <p>If \(\tilde f_1\) and \(\tilde f_2\) are two extensions of \(f\), then \(g = \tilde{f_1} - \tilde{f_2}\) vanishes on $\mathbb{S}^2$.

What I mean by the former statement “Tangent vectors annihilate normal components” is that derivatives along tangent directions ignore any part of a function that only varies off the manifold, because those variations are invisible to curves that stay on the manifold.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="intrinsic-vs-extrinsic-viewpoints-summary">Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Viewpoints (Summary)</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Aspect</th> <th>Intrinsic</th> <th>Extrinsic</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Tangent vector</td> <td>Derivation</td> <td>Vector in \(\mathbb{R}^3\)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Definition</td> <td>Via charts</td> <td>Via embedding</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Computation</td> <td>Pullback</td> <td>Directional derivative</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dependence</td> <td>Coordinate-dependent</td> <td>Embedding-dependent</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Both viewpoints are <strong>equivalent</strong> when an embedding exists.</p> <hr/> <p>Something to note from the above example:</p> <blockquote> <p>Coordinate vector fields are <strong>defined intrinsically as derivations</strong>,<br/> may be <strong>represented extrinsically</strong> using embeddings,<br/> and act on functions in a way that is <strong>independent of extensions</strong> because tangent vectors annihilate normal components.</p> </blockquote> <p>Through this simple example we already develop a taste of the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry, the abstract definitions and concrete calculations.

For instance, on a sphere, geodesics (shortest paths) come closer together compared to flat space; on a hyperbolic surface, they diverge.</p> <p>Ricci curvature is a particular way of summarizing curvature: Instead of describing how all directions bend (that’s what the full <strong>Riemann curvature tensor</strong> does), Ricci curvature focuses on <strong>volume distortion</strong>. More concretely, it tells us how the volume of a small geodesic ball deviates from the volume we’d expect in flat Euclidean space.</p> <p>Intuitively, we could summarize into the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>Positive Ricci curvature (like on a sphere) means geodesics tend to converge, and small balls have less volume than in flat space.</p> <p>Zero Ricci curvature (like in Euclidean space) means geodesics neither converge nor diverge, so volumes match Euclidean.</p> <p>Negative Ricci curvature (like on a hyperbolic space) means geodesics diverge, so small balls have more volume than Euclidean.</p> </blockquote> <p>Mathematically, Ricci curvature is obtained by “tracing” the <strong>Riemann curvature tensor</strong>. It compresses information about how different directions curve into a symmetric 2-tensor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ric</code>.</p> <h3 id="riemannian-geometry-and-tensor">Riemannian Geometry and Tensor</h3> <p>The Riemann tensor is written in the following way:</p> \[R(X, Y)Z = \nabla_X \nabla_Y Z - \nabla_Y \nabla_X Z - \nabla_{[X, Y]} Z\] <p>This tensor captures all information about curvature. Succinctly, this is a 4-tensor: \(R_{ijkl}\).</p> <p>The above is an unfair treatment of Riemannian geometry. I’ll have a separate blog on that subject soon.</p> <p>How to understand: Riemannian metric tensor informs the manifold where to expand, shrink, and curve. How does Riemannian metric tensor relate with curvature?</p> <h3 id="ricci-curvature">Ricci Curvature</h3> <p>Based on the Riemann tensor, what is the curvature?</p> <p>To get Ricci curvature, we take a <strong>trace</strong> of the Riemann tensor:</p> \[Ric_{ij} = R^{k}_{ikj} = g^{kl}R_{kilj}\] <p>This reduces the information down to a 2-tensor (like the metric itself). Geometrically, this represents the volume distortion of geodesic balls.</p> <h3 id="ricci-flow">Ricci Flow</h3> <p>Introduced by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Richard Hamilton (1982)</code>, Ricci flow is a process that evolves a Riemannian metric \(g(t)\) over time:</p> \[\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial t} = -2 Ric_{ij}\] <p>The factor -2 is just convention (to simplify later computations). We could think of this as a heat equation for geometry: Just as heat diffuses to smooth out temperature differences, Ricci flow smooths out <strong>irregularities</strong> in curvature. As illustrated in the above section of Ricci curvature, we could naturally arrive at the result that positive curvature regions tend to shrink and negative curvature regions expand. Over time, the underlying geometry becomes more “regular”, like ironing out wrinkles.</p> <p>The effect of Ricci flow on curvature could be expressed in the following way. The derivative of scalar curvature \(R\) under this flow is:</p> \[\frac{\partial R}{\partial t} = \Delta R + 2 |Ric|^2\] <p>This resembles a heat equation $(\Delta R)$ plus a positive correction. Consequently, curvature tends to diffuse out but also grows in positive-curvature regions.</p> <h4 id="examples-of-ricci-flow">Examples of Ricci Flow</h4> <p>Perhaps the simplest example is to imagine how a sphere evolves under Ricci flow. We all know that a round sphere has positive Ricci curvature. The Ricci flow equation says:</p> \[\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial t} = -2 Ric_{ij}\] <p>Since Ricci is positive, the metric shrinks, and thus makes the sphere to contract uniformly, eventually collapsing to a point. This closely mirrors the idea that positive curvature makes geodesics converge. Under the Ricci flow, it tightens further.</p> <p>Another simple example is the flat torus. Since the Ricci curvature is 0 everywhere,</p> \[\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial t} = 0\] <p>the torus will stay unchanged after the flow forever. This is analogous to heat diffusion on a perfectly uniform temperature field where nothing would effectively changes.</p> <p>Likewise, a hyperbolic surface has negative Ricci curvature. Consequently, under the Ricci flow, the metric would expand and the hyperbolic surface would grow larger and more uniform in curvature.</p> <p>In a nutshell, irregular geometries with bumps or folds (different curvature in different regions) get “smoothed” over time. All the high-curvature “wrinkles” would get flatten out, like how heat equalizes temperature.</p> <h3 id="application-of-ricci-flow">Application of Ricci Flow</h3> <p>Poincare conjecture, Ricci flow, surgery theory, what Terrence Tao called “one of the most impressive recent achievements of modern mathematics”</p> <p>Poincare conjecture:</p> <blockquote> <p>Any closed 3-manifold that is simply-connected, compact, and boundless is homeomorphic to a 3-sphere.</p> </blockquote> <p>Specifically, Poincare conjecture in higher dimensions has been solved around 1961, and dimension 4 case has been proved by Michael Freedman who by which won Fields medal in 1986. The \(n = 3\) case seemed really difficult to crack and it was only at 2002 that Grisha Perelman proved it using Ricci flow.</p> <p>Very briefly, since a sphere has positive curvature, by applying Ricci flow through time such sphere will contract and eventually vanish. Perelman proved the opposite also holds: if metric goes to 0, it must have been a sphere. To prove Poincare’s conjecture using Ricci flow,</p> <p>One of the most triumphant use of Ricci flow happens when Grigori Perelman (2002–2003) to prove <strong>the Poincaré conjecture</strong> and the more general <strong>Thurston geometrization conjecture</strong>. He showed how Ricci flow with “surgery” (cutting and patching when singularities form) classifies 3-manifolds.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Differential Geometry"/><category term="Geometry Concepts/Tools"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction of Ricci flows/curvatures]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Dance of Space (2): Differential Forms (in progress)</title><link href="https://jasmineruixiang.github.io/blog/2025/Differential_Forms/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Dance of Space (2): Differential Forms (in progress)"/><published>2025-09-16T16:34:22+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-16T16:34:22+00:00</updated><id>https://jasmineruixiang.github.io/blog/2025/Differential_Forms</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jasmineruixiang.github.io/blog/2025/Differential_Forms/"><![CDATA[<p>The second episode to appreciate the inner workings of space is through the differential forms.
