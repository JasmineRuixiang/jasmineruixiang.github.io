I'm currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering (BME) working in the BrainGate Lab at Brown University. My primary focus is on exploring how movement contexts are represented in neural space and novel decoding algorithms for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). I'm especially passionate about embedding into the decoder some prior knowledge from geometry and topology. 

Before joining BrainGate at 2023, I spent my undergraduate in Johns Hopkins University triple majoring in BME, Applied Math, and Pure Math. I was greteful for working under the supervision of Dr. Nitish Thakor and mentored by Catherine (Keqin) Ding on characterizing cognitive perception by ERP P300 signals. 

In my free time I play classic piano, acoustic guitar, and make post rock music. I also regularly write modern Chinese poems and am currently drafting a book titled `Existence and Transcendence` to assimilate my reflections across science, engineering, art, literature, and music, etc. Feel free to contact me for samples of chapters if you are interested.
