I'm currently a 2nd year Ph.D. student working in BrainGate Lab at Brown University, focusing on novel decoding algorithms for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). I majored in BME, Applied Math, and Pure Math for Undergraduate back in Johns Hopkins University. I play classic piano, acoustic guitar, and make post rock music. I also write modern Chinese poems. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
