I'm currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student working in BrainGate Lab at Brown University, focusing on exploring how movement contexts are represented in neural space and novel decoding algorithms for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) with modelling priors from geometry and topology. I majored in BME, Applied Math, and Pure Math for Undergraduate back in Johns Hopkins University. 

In my free time I play classic piano, acoustic guitar, and make post rock music. I also regularly write modern Chinese poems and am currently working on a book titled `Existence and Transcendence`.
