This is episode 2 on the smooth manifold series. Today we will be diving into concepts that appear initially very intuitive at first glance, but then the extended version of which is indeed quite abstract. 

### Definition of Tangent Space
Let $$M$$ be a manifold, the tangent space at $$p \in M$$, denoted as $$T_pM$$, is the the vector space of all derivations at $$p$$. Notice that a derivation at $$p$$ is a __linear__ map:

$$
D: C^{\infty}(M) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

satisfying the Leibniz rule:

$$
D(fg) = f(p)D(g) + g(p)D(f), \; \forall f, g \in C^{\infty}(M)
$$

Intuitively, $$D$$ is like a directional derivative operator acting on smooth functions near $$p$$. Consequently, $$T_p{M} = \{D | D \text{ is a derivation at } p\}$$
