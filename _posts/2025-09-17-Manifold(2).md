This is episode 2 on the smooth manifold series. Today we will be diving into concepts that appear initially very intuitive at first glance, but then the extended version of which is indeed quite abstract. 

## Familiar examples
Let me start with two simple concrete examples to illustrate what tangent vectors and tangent space are. Indeed they match up to our intuition!

Let's first say that we have a unit circle in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, or basically let's denote it as $$S^1$$ (this is a standard notation as 

$$
S^{n} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \mid |x| = 1 \}
$$, 

representing the surface of an $$(n+1)$$-dimensional ball). Pick $$p = (1, 0)$$. If I ask you what the tangent vector is starting at $$p$$ and tangnet to $$S^1$$? Your answer is probably a vector pointing upward or downward with its tail at $$p$$. Indeed, 



## Three equivalent definitions of Tangent Space
We'll cover three equivalent definitions tangent space. 

### [1] Tangent vectors are equivalence classes of curves

The definiton of homeomorphism and charts allow us to pull functional analysis from $$C^{\infty}(M)$$ or $$C^{\infty}(M, N)$$ on $$M$$ into $$\mathbb{R^n}$$ itself and thus we could proceed with techqniues built within the Euclidean space. Later when defining tangent/cotangent space from the geometric standpoint, we will see another side of the same story. 

tangent vectors are equivalence classes of smooth curves through $$p$$:

$$T_pM = \{\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t = 0} \gamma(t) \Big| \gamma: (\epsilon, \epsilon) \rightarrow M, \; \gamma(0) = p \}$$

where $$\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$$ if in some (equivalently, any) coordinate chart $$\phi: U \subset M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$$:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t = 0} \phi(\gamma_1(t)) = \frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t = 0} \phi(\gamma_2(t))$$

Consequently,  each tangent vector is represented by the velocity of a curve through $$p$$. 



### [2] Tangent vectors are derivations at $$p$$
Let $$M$$ be a manifold, the tangent space at $$p \in M$$, denoted as $$T_pM$$, is the the vector space of all derivations at $$p$$. Notice that a derivation at $$p$$ is a __linear__ operator (at $$p$$):

$$
D: C^{\infty}_{p}(M) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

satisfying the Leibniz rule:

$$
D(fg) = f(p)D(g) + g(p)D(f), \; \forall f, g \in C^{\infty}(M)
$$

where $$C^{\infty}_{p}$$ is the equivalence class of $$(f, U)$$, where $$f \in C^{\infty}$$ and $$U$$ is a neighbourhood of $$p$$. Two functions $$(f, U)$$ and $$(g, V)$$ are equivalent iff $$\exist \; W \subset U \cap V$$ a neighbourhood of $$p$$ such that $$f(x) = g(x),  \forall x \in W$$, where $$g \in C^{\infty}$$ and $$V$$ is a neighbourhood of $$p$$. 

Intuitively, $$D$$ is like a directional derivative operator acting on smooth functions near $$p$$. Consequently, 

$$
T_p{M} = \{ D \mid D \; \mathrm{is\ a\ derivation\ at} p \}
$$ 

and a tangent vector $$v \in T_p{M}$$ is a derivation $$D$$. In fact, Tu (Theorem 2.2, An introduction to manifolds) showed that there's a bijection between derivations at $$p$$ and directional derivaties. 

### [3] Tangent vectors as equivalences on function germs


### Local coordinate description
Specifically if we adopt interpretation [2], then with $$(U, \phi)$$ a chart with coordinates $$(x^1, \dots, x^n)$$ near $$p$$ 

$$
\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}\Big|_p, \dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\Big|_p \}
$$ 

form a basis of $$T_pM$$. 

Thus any tangent vector $$v$$ can be written uniquely as

$$v = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} v^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big|_p$$

where $$(v^1, \dots, v^n)$$ are the components of the vector in this coordinate system.


## Equivalence between derivations and curves
Perhaps not so surprisingly, the above two definitions are compatible and even equivalent to one another. 

From curves to derivations:

## A concrete computational example
A coherent walkthrough using the sphere $$ S^2 $$

Let's re-emphasize again that a vector field on a Manifold is defined as the following:

Let $$ M $$ be a smooth manifold. A **vector field** on $$ M $$ is a smooth section/assignment
\[
p \mapsto X_p \in T_p M
\]
where $$ T_p M $$ is the tangent space at $$ p $$.

**Fundamental viewpoint**:
> A tangent vector is a **derivation**: a linear map
\[
X_p : C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}
\]
satisfying the Leibniz rule.

We'll also give the local coordinates and coordinate vector fields as the following:

Let
\[
(U, \varphi), \quad \varphi : U \subset M \to V \subset \mathbb{R}^n
\]
be a coordinate chart, with coordinates
\[
(x^1, \dots, x^n).
\]

Each coordinate $$ x^i $$ is itself a **function on the manifold**:
\[
x^i : U \to \mathbb{R}.
\]

Definition of the "Coordinate Vector Field":

The coordinate vector field
\[
\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p
\]
is defined **intrinsically** by its action on smooth functions:
\[
\boxed{
\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p(f) :=
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
\big(f \circ \varphi^{-1}\big)
\Big(\varphi(p)\Big)
}
\]
where $$ x^i $$ is the $$ i $$-th coordinate on $$ \mathbb{R}^n $$.

Notice that there's an abuse of notation (the left "partial" is what we define, whereas the right partial is the usual partial differentiation). Hopefully, it's obvious that the above definition stems from the following basic definition of graph differential (which I will talk more into next time):

\[
\boxed{
(dF_p(v))(f) := v_p(f \circ F)
}
\]

More importantly, this definition:
- uses **only** the chart,
- does **not** require an embedding,
- explains what “$$ \partial f / \partial x^i $$” actually means.

---

Now, let's take a look at the simple example: Sphere $$ S^2 $$ and spherical coordinates. Given the manifold
\[
S^2 = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\}
\]

Coordinate chart (away from poles)

\[
(\theta, \varphi)
\]
with embedding map
\[
X(\theta,\varphi) =
(\sin\varphi\cos\theta,\;
 \sin\varphi\sin\theta,\;
 \cos\varphi).
\]

Here:
- $$ \theta, \varphi $$ are **functions on $$ S^2 $$**,
- not abstract variables.

According to the above discussions, the **intrinsic** meaning of $$ \partial / \partial \theta $$ and $$ \partial / \partial \varphi $$ are the following:

For any $$ f : S^2 \to \mathbb{R} $$,
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(f) =
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
\big(f \circ \varphi^{-1}\big)(\theta,\varphi),
\quad
\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi}(f) =
\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi}
\big(f \circ \varphi^{-1}\big).
\]

Again, this is the **definition**, not an interpretation. This offers us one way to calculate the vector field/tangent vectors at $\forall p \in M$.

---

However, because $$ S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3 $$, we may compute concrete representatives by viewing it as an embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and to extrinsically compute the vector fields by pushforward of coordinate basis vectors:

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} =
\frac{\partial X}{\partial \theta} =
(-\sin\varphi\sin\theta,\;
  \sin\varphi\cos\theta,\;
  0)
\]

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi} =
\frac{\partial X}{\partial \varphi}=
(\cos\varphi\cos\theta,\;
 \cos\varphi\sin\theta,\;
 -\sin\varphi)
\]

These are **actual vectors in $$ \mathbb{R}^3 $$** tangent to $$ S^2 $$.

> Important:  
> This is **not the definition** of coordinate vector fields —  
> it is a **representation** using the embedding.

Consequently, we could act on functions without pulling back to coordinate space:

Let
\[
f(p) = z(p)
\]
be a function on $$ S^2 $$.

Choose an extension
\[
\tilde f(x,y,z) = z
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\nabla \tilde f = (0,0,1).
\]

#### Key principle

Once a tangent vector is represented in $$ \mathbb{R}^3 $$,
\[
\boxed{
X(f)(p) = \nabla \tilde f(p) \cdot X_p
}
\]

---

### Example 1: $$ X = \partial/\partial\theta $$

\[
X(f)=
(0,0,1)
\cdot
(-\sin\varphi\sin\theta,\;
  \sin\varphi\cos\theta,\;
  0)
= 0
\]

---

### Example 2: $$ Y = \partial/\partial\varphi $$

\[
Y(f)=
(0,0,1)
\cdot
(\cos\varphi\cos\theta,\;
 \cos\varphi\sin\theta,\;
 -\sin\varphi)
= -\sin\varphi
\]

Same results as the intrinsic definition.

---

To be rigorous, you may be concerned about the specific use of the extension. However, we could show that extensions do not matter, because __"tangent vectors annihilate normal components”__. Let me explain below:

If $$ g : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R} $$ satisfies
\[
g|_{S^2} = 0,
\]
then for all $$ v \in T_p S^2 $$,
\[
v(g) = 0.
\]

---

### Proof (via curves):

Let $$ \gamma(t) \subset S^2 $$ with
\[
\gamma(0)=p, \quad \gamma'(0)=v.
\]

Since $$ g(\gamma(t)) = 0 $$ for all $$ t $$,
\[
v(g) = \frac{d}{dt} g(\gamma(t))\big|_{t=0} = 0.
\]

---

### Concrete example

Let
\[
g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1.
\]

Then:
\[
\nabla g = (2x,2y,2z)
\]
which is normal to $$ S^2 $$.

For any tangent vector $$ v $$,
\[
v(g) = \nabla g \cdot v = 0.
\]

---

### Consequence (crucial)

If $$ \tilde f_1 $$ and $$ \tilde f_2 $$ are two extensions of $$ f $$,
then:
\[
v(\tilde f_1) = v(\tilde f_2)
\quad\forall v \in T_p S^2.
\]

Hence directional derivatives along tangent vectors are **well-defined**.

---

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Viewpoints (Summary)

| Aspect | Intrinsic | Extrinsic |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Tangent vector | Derivation | Vector in $$ \mathbb{R}^3 $$ |
| Definition | Via charts | Via embedding |
| Computation | Pullback | Directional derivative |
| Dependence | Coordinate-dependent | Embedding-dependent |

Both viewpoints are **equivalent** when an embedding exists.

---

Something to note from the above example:
> Coordinate vector fields are **defined intrinsically as derivations**,  
> may be **represented extrinsically** using embeddings,  
> and act on functions in a way that is **independent of extensions** because tangent vectors annihilate normal components.

Through this simple example we already develop a taste of the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry, the abstract definitions and concrete calculations. Such theme will be recurring for our journey in studying differential geometry. 







## Discussions
Firstly, note that tangent/cotangent space is an intrinsic? property. A usual image of interpreting tangent space is $$S^2$$ embedded in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$. Our definition above does not require so, and in fact the shift of perspective from extrinsic into intrinsic properties of geometric objects is a grand evolution starting from Gauss and Rieman.
