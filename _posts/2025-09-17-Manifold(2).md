This is episode 2 on the smooth manifold series. Today we will be diving into concepts that appear initially very intuitive at first glance, but then the extended version of which is indeed quite abstract. 

## Three equivalent definition of Tangent Space
We'll cover three equivalent definitions tangent space. 

### [1] Tangent vectors are equivalence classes of curves


### [2] Tangent vectors are derivations at $$p$$
Let $$M$$ be a manifold, the tangent space at $$p \in M$$, denoted as $$T_pM$$, is the the vector space of all derivations at $$p$$. Notice that a derivation at $$p$$ is a __linear__ operator (at $$p$$):

$$
D: C^{\infty}_{p}(M) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

satisfying the Leibniz rule:

$$
D(fg) = f(p)D(g) + g(p)D(f), \; \forall f, g \in C^{\infty}(M)
$$

where $$C^{\infty}_{p}$$ is the equivalence class of $$(f, U)$$, where $$f \in C^{\infty}$$ and $$U$$ is a neighbourhood of $$p$$. Two functions $$(f, U)$$ and $$(g, V)$$ are equivalent iff $$\exist \; W \subset U \cap V$$ a neighbourhood of $$p$$ such that $$f(x) = g(x),  \forall x \in W$$, where $$g \in C^{\infty}$$ and $$V$$ is a neighbourhood of $$p$$. 

Intuitively, $$D$$ is like a directional derivative operator acting on smooth functions near $$p$$. Consequently, $$T_p{M} = \{D | D \text{ is a derivation at } p \}$$ and a tangent vector $$v \in T_p{M}$$ is a derivation $$D$$. In fact, Tu (Theorem 2.2, An introduction to manifolds) showed that there's a bijection between derivations at $$p$$ and directional derivaties. 

### Equivalence between derivations and curves
Perhaps not so surprisingly, the above two definitions are compatible and even equivalent to one another.
