This is episode 2 on the smooth manifold series. Today we will be diving into concepts that appear initially very intuitive at first glance, but then the extended version of which is indeed quite abstract. 

## 0] Familiar examples
Let me start with two simple concrete examples to illustrate what tangent vectors and tangent space are. Indeed they match up to our intuition!

Let's first say that we have a unit circle in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, or basically let's denote it as $$S^1$$ (this is a standard notation as 

$$
S^{n} = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \mid |x| = 1 \}
$$, 

representing the surface of an $$(n+1)$$-dimensional ball). Pick $$p = (1, 0)$$. If I ask you what the tangent vector is starting at $$p$$ and tangnet to $$S^1$$? Your answer is probably a vector pointing upward or downward with its tail at $$p$$. Indeed, 



## 1] Three equivalent definitions of Tangent Space
We'll cover three equivalent definitions tangent space. 

### 1.1] Tangent vectors are equivalence classes of curves

The definiton of homeomorphism and charts allow us to pull functional analysis from $$C^{\infty}(M)$$ or $$C^{\infty}(M, N)$$ on $$M$$ into $$\mathbb{R^n}$$ itself and thus we could proceed with techqniues built within the Euclidean space. Later when defining tangent/cotangent space from the geometric standpoint, we will see another side of the same story. 

tangent vectors are equivalence classes of smooth curves through $$p$$:

$$T_pM = \{\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t = 0} \gamma(t) \Big| \gamma: (\epsilon, \epsilon) \rightarrow M, \; \gamma(0) = p \}$$

where $$\gamma_1 \sim \gamma_2$$ if in some (equivalently, any) coordinate chart $$\phi: U \subset M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$$:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t = 0} \phi(\gamma_1(t)) = \frac{d}{dt}\Big|_{t = 0} \phi(\gamma_2(t))$$

Consequently,  each tangent vector is represented by the velocity of a curve through $$p$$. 



### 1.2] Tangent vectors are derivations at $$p$$
Let $$M$$ be a manifold, the tangent space at $$p \in M$$, denoted as $$T_pM$$, is the the vector space of all derivations at $$p$$. Notice that a derivation at $$p$$ is a __linear__ operator (at $$p$$):

$$
D: C^{\infty}_{p}(M) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

satisfying the Leibniz rule:

$$
D(fg) = f(p)D(g) + g(p)D(f), \; \forall f, g \in C^{\infty}(M)
$$

where $$C^{\infty}_{p}$$ is the equivalence class of $$(f, U)$$, where $$f \in C^{\infty}$$ and $$U$$ is a neighbourhood of $$p$$. Two functions $$(f, U)$$ and $$(g, V)$$ are equivalent iff $$\exist \; W \subset U \cap V$$ a neighbourhood of $$p$$ such that $$f(x) = g(x),  \forall x \in W$$, where $$g \in C^{\infty}$$ and $$V$$ is a neighbourhood of $$p$$. 

Intuitively, $$D$$ is like a directional derivative operator acting on smooth functions near $$p$$. Consequently, 

$$
T_p{M} = \{ D \mid D \; \mathrm{is\ a\ derivation\ at} p \}
$$ 

and a tangent vector $$v \in T_p{M}$$ is a derivation $$D$$. In fact, Tu (Theorem 2.2, An introduction to manifolds) showed that there's a bijection between derivations at $$p$$ and directional derivaties. 

### 1.3] Tangent vectors as equivalences on function germs


## 2] Local coordinate description
Specifically if we adopt interpretation [2], then with $$(U, \phi)$$ a chart with coordinates $$(x^1, \dots, x^n)$$ near $$p$$ 

$$
\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}\Big|_p, \dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\Big|_p \}
$$ 

form a basis of $$T_pM$$. 

Thus any tangent vector $$v$$ can be written uniquely as

$$v = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} v^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\Big|_p$$

where $$(v^1, \dots, v^n)$$ are the components of the vector in this coordinate system.


## 3] Equivalence between derivations and curves
Perhaps not so surprisingly, the above two definitions are compatible and even equivalent to one another. 

From curves to derivations:

## 4] A concrete computational example
A coherent walkthrough using the sphere $$ S^2 $$

Let's re-emphasize again that a vector field on a Manifold is defined as the following:

Let $$ M $$ be a smooth manifold. A **vector field** on $$ M $$ is a smooth section/assignment
$$
p \mapsto X_p \in T_p M
$$
where $$ T_p M $$ is the tangent space at $$ p $$.

**Fundamental viewpoint**:
> A tangent vector is a **derivation**: a linear map
$$
X_p : C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}
$$
satisfying the Leibniz rule.

We'll also give the local coordinates and coordinate vector fields as the following:

Let
$$
(U, \varphi), \quad \varphi : U \subset M \to V \subset \mathbb{R}^n
$$
be a coordinate chart, with coordinates
$$
(x^1, \dots, x^n).
$$

Each coordinate $$ x^i $$ is itself a **function on the manifold**:
$$
x^i : U \to \mathbb{R}.
$$

Definition of the "Coordinate Vector Field":

The coordinate vector field
$$
\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p
$$
is defined **intrinsically** by its action on smooth functions:
$$
\boxed{
\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}\right|_p(f) :=
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
\big(f \circ \varphi^{-1}\big)
\Big(\varphi(p)\Big)
}
$$
where $$ x^i $$ is the $$ i $$-th coordinate on $$ \mathbb{R}^n $$.

Notice that there's an abuse of notation (the left "partial" is what we define, whereas the right partial is the usual partial differentiation). Hopefully, it's obvious that the above definition stems from the following basic definition of graph differential (which I will talk more into next time):

$$
\boxed{
(dF_p(v))(f) := v_p(f \circ F)
}
$$

More importantly, this definition:
- uses **only** the chart, 
- does **not** require an embedding and thus does $NOT$ give us components in $\mathbb{R}^n$
- explains what “$$ \partial f / \partial x^i $$” actually means: It means the ordinary partial derivative of the coordinate expression of $f$ after pulling $f$ back to a coordinate chart.Note that nothing is being differentiated on $\mathbb{R}^n$ unless we explicitly choose an embedding (see below).

---

Now, let's take a look at the simple example: Sphere $$ S^2 $$ and spherical coordinates. Given the manifold
$$
S^2 = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\}
$$

Coordinate chart (away from poles)

$$
(\theta, \varphi)
$$
with embedding map
$$
F(\theta,\varphi) =
(\sin\varphi\cos\theta,\;
 \sin\varphi\sin\theta,\;
 \cos\varphi).
$$

Here:
- $$ \theta, \varphi $$ are **functions on $$ S^2 $$**,
- not abstract variables.

According to the above discussions, the **intrinsic** meaning of $$ \partial / \partial \theta $$ and $$ \partial / \partial \varphi $$ are the following:

For any $$ f : S^2 \to \mathbb{R} $$,
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(f) =
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
\big(f \circ \varphi^{-1}\big)(\theta,\varphi),
\quad
\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi}(f) =
\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi}
\big(f \circ \varphi^{-1}\big).
$$

Again, this is the **definition**, not an interpretation. This offers us one way to calculate the vector field/tangent vectors at $\forall p \in M$.

If we set 

$$f(x, y, z) = z$$, then we could pull it back and obtain
$$(f \circ \phi^{-1})(\theta, \phi) = \cos(\phi)$$. Consequently, 

> Example 1:  $ X = \partial/\partial\theta $

$$
X_p(f)= \frac{\partial \cos(\phi)}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$

at $p = (\theta, \phi)$.

---
> Example 2: $ Y = \partial/\partial\varphi $

$$
Y_p(f)= \frac{\partial \cos(\phi)}{\partial \phi} = -\sin(\phi)
$$

at $p = (\theta, \phi)$.

---

However, because $$ S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3 $$, we may compute concrete representatives by viewing it as an embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and to extrinsically compute the vector fields by pushforward of coordinate basis vectors via the embedding map of the manifold. Consequently, such computation lives in the embedded picture, not the intrinsic definition.

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} =
\frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta} =
(-\sin\varphi\sin\theta,\;
  \sin\varphi\cos\theta,\;
  0)
$$

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi} =
\frac{\partial F}{\partial \varphi}=
(\cos\varphi\cos\theta,\;
 \cos\varphi\sin\theta,\;
 -\sin\varphi)
$$

These are **actual vectors in $$ \mathbb{R}^3 $$** tangent to $$ S^2 $$.

> Important:  
> This is **not the definition** of coordinate vector fields —  
> it is a **representation** using the embedding.

Consequently, we could act on functions without pulling back to coordinate space:

Let
$$
f(p) = z(p)
$$
be a function on $$ S^2 $$.

Choose an extension
$$
\tilde f(x,y,z) = z
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\nabla \tilde f = (0,0,1).
$$

Here's the key observation: 
> Once a tangent vector is represented in $$ \mathbb{R}^3 $$, its action on $$f$$ is given by the directional derivative of an extension of $$f$$.

Formally, 
$$
\boxed{
X_p(f) = \nabla \tilde f(p) \cdot X_p
}
$$ where 

* $$\tilde{f}$ is any smooth extension of $f$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$$
* $$X_p \in T_pS^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$$.

This works because tangent vectors annihilate normal components.

---

> Example 1: $$ X = \partial/\partial\theta $$

$$
X(f)=
(0,0,1)
\cdot
(-\sin\varphi\sin\theta,\;
  \sin\varphi\cos\theta,\;
  0)
= 0
$$

---

> Example 2: $$ Y = \partial/\partial\varphi $$

$$
Y(f)=
(0,0,1)
\cdot
(\cos\varphi\cos\theta,\;
 \cos\varphi\sin\theta,\;
 -\sin\varphi)
= -\sin\varphi
$$

Same results as the intrinsic definition.

Note that to be very concrete, in the above examples, at $p = (\theta, \phi)$, the tangent vector is:

$$X_p = (-\sin\varphi\sin\theta,\; \sin\varphi\cos\theta,\;0)$$ (we could interpret this as horizontal circles of latitude) and 
$$Y_p = (\cos\varphi\cos\theta,\; \cos\varphi\sin\theta,\ -\sin\varphi)$$. This should make it very clear that we are treating the tangent vectors as actually "vectors" living in $\mathbb{R}^3$ like how we usually refer them to be. With this extrinsic embedding, the general form of a vector field coincides with the intrinsic notion, but more tangible:

$$X = a(\theta, \phi)\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} + b(\theta, \phi)\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}$$, 

then as a vector in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$: $$X_p = a \frac{\partial F}{\partial \theta} + b\frac{\partial F}{\partial \phi}$$, and 

$$X_p(f) = \nabla \tilde{f}(p) \cdot X_p$$

Notice that for this computation no coordinate pullback is required. But to be crystal clear, we do __not__ compute the vector field “without coordinates”. We simply You replaced intrinsic coordinates on $\mathbb{S}^2$ by ambient Cartesian coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^3$. So coordinates are still there — just in a different space.

---
Before we continue, let's dwell on this formula for a while:

$$
\boxed{
X_p(f) = \nabla \tilde f(p) \cdot X_p
}
$$

This identity guarantees consistency between 1] the derivation definition and 2] the embedded vector representation (Question: is this just chain rule?s). It explains why the extrinsic calculation agrees with the intrinsic definition. If we have a nice embedding, two views are nice. However, if we go to the general abstract case without the ambient space, we could only assort to the intrinsic definition. 

---
To be rigorous, you may be concerned about the specific use of the function extension here. However, we could show that extensions do not matter, because __"tangent vectors annihilate normal components”__. Let me explain below:

If $$ g : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R} $$ satisfies
$$
g|_{S^2} = 0,
$$
then for all $$ v \in T_p S^2 $$,
$$
v(g) = 0.
$$
Equivalently, 
$$
\nabla g(p) \perp T_p\mathbb{S}^2
$$

---

### Proof (via curves):

Let $$ \gamma(t) \subset S^2 $$ with
$$
\gamma(0)=p, \quad \gamma'(0)=v.
$$

Since $$ g(\gamma(t)) = 0 $$ for all $$ t $$,
$$
v(g) = \frac{d}{dt} g(\gamma(t))\big|_{t=0} = 0.
$$

---

### Concrete example

Let
$$
g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1.
$$

Then:
$$
\nabla g = (2x,2y,2z)
$$
which is normal to $$ S^2 $$.

For any tangent vector $$ v $$,
$$
v(g) = \nabla g \cdot v = 0.
$$

---

### Consequence (crucial)

If $$ \tilde f_1 $$ and $$ \tilde f_2 $$ are two extensions of $$ f $$, then $$g = \tilde{f_1} - \tilde{f_2} $$ vanishes on $\mathbb{S}^2$. For any tangent vector $v$:

$$
v(\tilde f_1) - v(\tilde f_2) = v(\tilde g) = 0
$$

thus: 

$$
v(\tilde f_1) = v(\tilde f_2)
\quad\forall v \in T_p S^2.
$$

Hence directional derivatives along tangent vectors are **well-defined**: this is why directional derivatives along tangent vectors do not depend on how f extends off the manifold.

View from another perspective, this indicates that a function that is identically zero on the manifold cannot change when we move tangentially: so tangent vectors “don’t see” normal variations. What I mean by the former statement “Tangent vectors annihilate normal components” is that derivatives along tangent directions ignore any part of a function that only varies off the manifold, because those variations are invisible to curves that stay on the manifold.

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Viewpoints (Summary)

| Aspect | Intrinsic | Extrinsic |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Tangent vector | Derivation | Vector in $$ \mathbb{R}^3 $$ |
| Definition | Via charts | Via embedding |
| Computation | Pullback | Directional derivative |
| Dependence | Coordinate-dependent | Embedding-dependent |

Both viewpoints are **equivalent** when an embedding exists.

---

Something to note from the above example:
> Coordinate vector fields are **defined intrinsically as derivations**,  
> may be **represented extrinsically** using embeddings,  
> and act on functions in a way that is **independent of extensions** because tangent vectors annihilate normal components.

Through this simple example we already develop a taste of the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry, the abstract definitions and concrete calculations. Such theme will be recurring for our journey in studying differential geometry. 

One of the advantages of the intrinsic view is that it is independent of coordinate charts. It paves the ground for explaining why 
> __Gradients, geodesics, and Lie brackets make sense without embedding (or ever mentioning) the abstract manifold into $\mathbb{R}^n$__. 







## 4] Discussions
Firstly, note that tangent/cotangent space is an intrinsic? property. A usual image of interpreting tangent space is $$S^2$$ embedded in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$. Our definition above does not require so, and in fact the shift of perspective from extrinsic into intrinsic properties of geometric objects is a grand evolution starting from Gauss and Rieman. 

[TODO: An illustrative figure of a sphere embedded in Euclidean space]

From derivations to curves:

### 4.1] Abuse of notation
Many textbooks will carry abuse of notation throughout their content, most often conflating functions/derivations defined on the manifold with them composed with local coordinates. I find it really confusing and hard to interpret many times, so I decide to, once again, present one simple example where no abuse of notation whatsoever happens, so we could get it crystal clear. Let's begin. 










### 4.2] Orthonormal basis?
Another subtle point that haunted me for while is the questions of whether the basis $$\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\Big|_p\right\}_{i=1,2,...,n}$$ are orthonormal or not.

The short answer is No. The coordinate basis is **not necessarily orthonormal**. It's true that these vectors:

- Form a basis of $$T_pM$$.
- Depend on the coordinate choice.
- Are defined geometrically as directional derivatives.

However, nothing in their definition guarantees that they are orthogonal or normalized. In fact, even more basic, orthonormality requires a __metric__! To even ask whether a basis is orthonormal, we must have a **Riemannian metric** $$g$$ (will talk about this in details later; readers not familiar with metric/Riemannian metric feel free to please come back later; I include this short discussion for completeness and I apologize for grabbing future yet-to-be-learned knowledge as part of this section's story). Without a metric, we cannot measure angles and lengths, and thus “orthonormal” is meaningless.

But even given a Riemannian metric $$g$$, usually orthonormality is not guaranteed. We can easily compute

$$
g_{ij}(p)
= g\!\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\right)_p.
$$

In general,

$$
g_{ij}(p) \neq \delta_{ij}.
$$

So the coordinate basis is usually **not orthonormal**.

Let's do a simlpe example: the sphere. Consider the 2-sphere $$S^2$$ with spherical coordinates $$(\theta, \phi)$$.

Given a metric:

$$
ds^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2.
$$

Then:

$$
g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right) = 1,
$$

$$
g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\right) = \sin^2\theta.
$$

These coordinate vectors are indeed:

- Orthogonal.
- But **not normalized** unless $$\sin\theta = 1$$.

Even in nice coordinates, the basis is typically not orthonormal.

So then when are they orthonormal? As said above, they are orthonormal only if

$$
g_{ij}(p) = \delta_{ij}.
$$

This happens in special cases, like in 

* Case 1: Euclidean Space. In $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ with the standard metric,

$$
g_{ij} = \delta_{ij},
$$

so the coordinate basis is orthonormal everywhere.

* Case 2: Riemannian Normal Coordinates: On any Riemannian manifold, we can construct **normal coordinates** around $$p$$ such that

$$
g_{ij}(p) = \delta_{ij}.
$$

However, this holds only at the single point $$p$$. Away from $$p$$, the metric is no longer Euclidean. On a side note, this reflects a deep geometric fact:

> Every Riemannian manifold looks Euclidean to first order at a point.

To do a short summary and comparison:

Coordinate basis vectors:
- Depend on how we label the manifold.
- Reflect the coordinate grid.
- May stretch or skew according to the geometry.

An orthonormal basis instead:
- Is chosen using the __metric__.
- Is independent of coordinates.
- Can be obtained via Gram–Schmidt if needed.
