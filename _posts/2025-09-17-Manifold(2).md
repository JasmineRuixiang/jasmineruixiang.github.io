This is episode 2 on the smooth manifold series. Today we will be diving into concepts that appear initially very intuitive at first glance, but then the extended version of which is indeed quite abstract. 

## Familiar examples
Let me start with two simple concrete examples to illustrate what tangent vectors and tangent space are. Indeed they match up to our intuition!

Let's first say that we have a unit circle in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, or basically let's denote it as $$S^1$$ (this is a standard notation as $$S^n = \{ x \in \mathbb{R^{n+1}} \mid |x| = 1 \}$$, representing the surface of an $$(n+1)$$-dimensional ball). Pick $$p = (1, 0)$$. If I ask you what the tangent vector is starting at $$p$$ and tangnet to $$S^1$$? Your answer is probably a vector pointing upward or downward with its tail at $$p$$. Indeed, 



## Three equivalent definitions of Tangent Space
We'll cover three equivalent definitions tangent space. 

### [1] Tangent vectors are equivalence classes of curves

The definiton of homeomorphism and charts allow us to pull functional analysis from $$C^{\infty}(M)$$ or $$C^{\infty}(M, N)$$ on $$M$$ into $$\mathbb{R^n}$$ itself and thus we could proceed with techqniues built within the Euclidean space. Later when defining tangent/cotangent space from the geometric standpoint, we will see another side of the same story. 

### [2] Tangent vectors are derivations at $$p$$
Let $$M$$ be a manifold, the tangent space at $$p \in M$$, denoted as $$T_pM$$, is the the vector space of all derivations at $$p$$. Notice that a derivation at $$p$$ is a __linear__ operator (at $$p$$):

$$
D: C^{\infty}_{p}(M) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

satisfying the Leibniz rule:

$$
D(fg) = f(p)D(g) + g(p)D(f), \; \forall f, g \in C^{\infty}(M)
$$

where $$C^{\infty}_{p}$$ is the equivalence class of $$(f, U)$$, where $$f \in C^{\infty}$$ and $$U$$ is a neighbourhood of $$p$$. Two functions $$(f, U)$$ and $$(g, V)$$ are equivalent iff $$\exist \; W \subset U \cap V$$ a neighbourhood of $$p$$ such that $$f(x) = g(x),  \forall x \in W$$, where $$g \in C^{\infty}$$ and $$V$$ is a neighbourhood of $$p$$. 

Intuitively, $$D$$ is like a directional derivative operator acting on smooth functions near $$p$$. Consequently, $$T_p{M} = \{ D \mid D \,\mathrm{is\ a\ derivation\ at}\ p \}$$ and a tangent vector $$v \in T_p{M}$$ is a derivation $$D$$. In fact, Tu (Theorem 2.2, An introduction to manifolds) showed that there's a bijection between derivations at $$p$$ and directional derivaties. 


### Equivalence between derivations and curves
Perhaps not so surprisingly, the above two definitions are compatible and even equivalent to one another. 

From curves to derivations:


### Discussions
Firstly, note that tangent/cotangent space is an intrinsic? property. A usual image of interpreting tangent space is $$S^2$$ embedded in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$. Our definition above does not require so, and in fact the shift of perspective from extrinsic into intrinsic properties of geometric objects is a grand evolution starting from Gauss and Rieman.
