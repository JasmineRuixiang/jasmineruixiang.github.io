Many years later, when I reflect back on the first quarter of the 21st century studies on computational neuroscience and  brain-computer interface (BCI), among papers on fancy Neural Network based decoders and clinical breakthroughs expanding from cursor and motor BCI to speech and vision,  I might still recollect a distant afternoon when I first heard the name Mark Churchland, and more specifically, neural population dynamics and jPCA. I perhaps first read the paper {% cite jpca %} at least a decade after it comes out. 

This post is a exploration into and summary of a classical paper {% cite jpca %}. I will extract a few key components of this article, specifically its dynamical systems interpretation and then summarize the jPCA algorithm. When I first read this article, I
