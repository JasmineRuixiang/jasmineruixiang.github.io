Many years later, when I reflect back on the first quarter of the 21st century studies on computational neuroscience and  brain-computer interface (BCI), among papers on fancy Neural Network based decoders and clinical breakthroughs expanding from cursor and motor BCI to speech and vision, I might still recollect a distant afternoon when I first heard the name Mark Churchland, and more specifically, neural population dynamics and jPCA. I perhaps first read the paper {% cite jpca %} at least a decade after it came out, but the astonishing finding and the elegance of the algorithm, together with its implicit influences on shaping my thoughts of neural populations made it a classic enduring the test of time. This post is both an exploration and a summary, where I will extract a few key components from the article {% cite jpca %}, specifically its dynamical systems interpretation and then summarize the jPCA algorithm. 

## Dynamical Systems Perspective
A traditional perspective characeterizes neural activities from the primary motor cortex (M1) as representing the corresponding movement parameters. Equivalently, we could write out a parametric equation:

$$
r_n(t) = f_n(param_{1}(t), param_{2}(t), param_{3}(t), ...) 
$$

where $r_n(t)$ is the firing rate for the nth neuron, tuned by the corresponding function $f_n$. Alternatively, another perspective based on neural population encoding which reflect behavior parameters not on the single neuron level, but on the population level, is written as follows, which characterize a __dynamical system__ perspective:

$$
\dot{r}(t) = f(r(t)) + u(t)
$$

In this view, the dynamics, i.e., the evolution of population response encodes the movement parameters. Here u(t) is an unknown external input. 

## Quasi-rthymic Responses 

## jPCA
Based on the dynamical systems perspective, since it's the time-dependent structure that we focus, a naive simple PCA is not sufficent to extract such temporal structures from neural activities, since PCA is not specificall designed for incapsulating dynamical structures. Here Churchland et al. developed an algorithm called jPCA to reoslve this issue. Specifically, it finds orthonormal axes (thus basis which define linear subspaces) which capture the strongest rotational components
