Many years later, when I reflect back on the first quarter of the 21st century studies on computational neuroscience and  brain-computer interface (BCI), among papers on fancy Neural Network based decoders and clinical breakthroughs expanding from cursor and motor BCI to speech and vision, I might still recollect a distant afternoon when I first heard the name Mark Churchland, and more specifically, neural population dynamics and jPCA. I perhaps first read the paper {% cite jpca %} at least a decade after it came out, but the astonishing finding and the elegance of the algorithm, together with its implicit influences on shaping my thoughts of neural populations made it a classic enduring the test of time. This post is both an exploration and a summary, where I will extract a few key components from the article {% cite jpca %}, specifically its dynamical systems interpretation and then summarize the jPCA algorithm. 

## Dynamical Systems Perspective
A traditional perspective characeterizes neural activities from the primary motor cortex (M1) as representing the corresponding movement parameters. Equivalently, we could write out a parametric equation:

$$
r_n(t) = f_n(param_{1}(t), param_{2}(t), param_{3}(t), ...) 
$$

where $r_n(t)$ is the firing rate for the nth neuron, tuned by the corresponding function $f_n$. Alternatively, another perspective based on neural population encoding which reflect behavior parameters not on the single neuron level, but on the population level, is written as follows, which characterize a __dynamical system__ perspective:

$$
\dot{r}(t) = f(r(t)) + u(t)
$$

In this view, the dynamics, i.e., the evolution of population response encodes the movement parameters. Here u(t) is an unknown external input. 

## Quasi-rthymic Responses 
As made clear in the article, the critical finding of this study is that reaching, a non-oscillatory movement (unlike the swimming leech or a walking monkey), leads to a quasi-oscillatory neural trajectory. More surprisingly, the rotations are distinct not by reaching curvatures but determined from the initial conditions, which are encoded by the __preparatory activities__. We will see that __preparatory activities__ feature as an essential ingredient in Churchland and colleagues' research, resulting in surpising analysis on nullspace/output-potent space later {% cite nullspace %}{% cite prep_review %}. Specifically, as the authors summaried, the trajectories have the following primary properties, which support the dynamical system perspective:

> 2asdfasasdfdf
> 3asdfasdf

An interesting reflection is that with the dynamical system perspective hypothesis, then the rotations of neural states should be similar no matter what reaching condition: only the initial conditions determine the trajectories, with the underlying $f$ being identical. I found this line of thought insightful, which demonstrates how important it is to deeply understand theory to deduce results, thought they might look unorthodox --- the neural states should be similar even when the reaches are in opposite directions. 


## jPCA
Based on the dynamical systems perspective, since it's the time-dependent structure that we focus, a naive simple PCA is not sufficent to extract such temporal structures from neural activities, since PCA is not specificall designed for incapsulating dynamical structures. Here Churchland et al. developed an algorithm called jPCA to reoslve this issue. Specifically, it finds orthonormal axes (thus basis which define linear subspaces) which capture the strongest rotational components from subspace identified by PCA (to ensure that the rotational dynamics come from subspaces that efficiently "represent" the high dimensional neural space). Conseuqently, this is equivalent to rotating the PCA projections to help us "see" the rotation most clearly (as shown in video below). In the paper the authors chose the PCA dimension as 6, and the data projected from the 6-D PCA space to the first 2 jPCA components, thus a plane which captures the strongest rotations, is displayed to reveal the underlying oscillatory structure. 

## Discussions
The extracted neural trajectory is only "quasi-oscillatory", and usually exists for barely 1 cycle. 

For many neurons, the preparatory and movement-related single neuron responses do exhibit some quasi-oscillations which last for about 1 cycle (See in below). Not sure yet if this explains the observed rotation structure at the population level. However, another question pops up that if this single neuron level rotation exists just before movement onset, how would the rotation be conssitent for the entire reaching movement? What provides the rotation for the later half of the reaching behavior?



## Open Questions
The jPCA method stems from dissecting the rotation component away from the general linear transformation. Can this be further stripped away from PCA?
