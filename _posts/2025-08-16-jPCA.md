Many years later, when I reflect back on the first quarter of the 21st century studies on computational neuroscience and  brain-computer interface (BCI), among papers on fancy Neural Network based decoders and clinical breakthroughs expanding from cursor and motor BCI to speech and vision, I might still recollect a distant afternoon when I first heard the name Mark Churchland, and more specifically, neural population dynamics and jPCA. I perhaps first read the paper {% cite jpca %} at least a decade after it came out, but the astonishing finding and the elegance of the algorithm, together with its implicit influences on shaping my thoughts of neural populations made it a classic enduring the test of time. This post is both an exploration and a summary, where I will extract a few key components from the article {% cite jpca %}, specifically its dynamical systems interpretation and then summarize the jPCA algorithm. 

## Dynamical Systems Perspective
A traditional perspective characeterizes neural activities from the primary motor cortex (M1) as representing the corresponding movement parameters. Equivalently, we could write out a parametric equation:

$$
r_n(t) = f_n(param_{1}(t), param_{2}(t), param_{3}(t), ...) 
$$
