The second episode to appreciate the inner workings of space is through the differential forms. Differential forms is not an ancient subject, ... 


### Vector Outer Product


### Wedge Product/Exterior Derivative


### Three in One 

Green's theorem, Gauss' theorem, Stoke's theorem. 

Green's theorem: 

$$
\int_{L} Pdx + Qdy = \iint_{D}(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y})dxdy
$$

Generalized Stoke's theorem. 

A k-form is supposed to be integrated over an oriented k-dimensional manifold

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTOC)
High dimensional Stoke's theorem is exactly the fundamental theorem of calculus (FTOC) in high-dimensional space.
