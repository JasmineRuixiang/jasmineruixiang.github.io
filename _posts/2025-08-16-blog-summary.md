        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/12.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

````markdown
```c++

```
````

```python
 j = 1
 for i in range(8):
    print(j + i)
```

1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.


The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight python linenos %}

 j = 1
 for i in range(8):
    print(j + i)

{% endhighlight %}

For displaying math, for example:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$

or 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.

Could also include Twitter:

# Tweet

An example of displaying a tweet:
{% twitter https://twitter.com/rubygems/status/518821243320287232 %}

For post-citation:

This is an example post that can be cited. The content of the post ends here, while the citation information is automatically provided below. The only thing needed is for you to set the `citation` key in the front matter to `true`.

<br>
For post-bibliography:

That means simple citation like {% cite einstein1950meaning %}, multiple citations like {% cite einstein1950meaning einstein1905movement %}, long references like {% reference einstein1905movement %} or also quotes:

{% quote einstein1905electrodynamics %}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing.
{% endquote %}

Table of contents:
To add a table of contents to a post, simply add

```yml
toc:
  beginning: true
```

to the front matter of the post. The table of contents will be automatically generated from the headings in the post.

To add a table of contents to a post as a sidebar, simply add

```yml
toc:
  sidebar: left
```

to the front matter of the post. The table of contents will be automatically generated from the headings in the post. If you wish to display the sidebar to the right, simply change `left` to `right`.

If you want to learn more about how to customize the table of contents of your sidebar, you can check the [bootstrap-toc](https://afeld.github.io/bootstrap-toc/) documentation. Notice that you can even customize the text of the heading that will be displayed on the sidebar.

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
