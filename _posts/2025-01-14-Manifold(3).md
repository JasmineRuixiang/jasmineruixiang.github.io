This is episode 3 on the smooth manifold series. Today we will be diving into the properties of maps between manifolds. I will first summarize how to understand and compute the differential of a smooth map between manifolds, both abstractly and concretely, culminating in the matrix-valued example  
$$
F(A) = A^\top A.
$$

## 1] Differential: canonical definition 
### 1.1 Differential of a Smooth Map (Intrinsic Definition)

Let
$$
F : M \to N
$$
be a smooth map between smooth manifolds.

For any point $ p \in M $, the **differential** is a linear map which is a __pushforward of derivations__. 
$$
dF_p : T_p M \longrightarrow T_{F(p)} N.
$$

### Derivation-based definition
If $ v \in T_p M $ is a tangent vector viewed as a derivation, then
$$
(dF_p v)(g) := v(g \circ F),
\qquad g \in C^\infty(N).
$$

This definition is **coordinate-free**.

It might appear at first both unnecessarily abstract and underestimated as to its computation. We might claim that it is essentially just a Jacobian matrix in local coordinates. However, the essence of this concept resides on its definition to be conceptually a coordinate-independent linear map between tangent spaces.

### 1.2 Coordinate Representation and the Jacobian

To compute $ dF_p $ in practice:

1. Choose a chart $ (U,\varphi) $ on $ M $ with $ p \in U $
2. Choose a chart $ (V,\psi) $ on $ N $ with $ F(p) \in V $

Define the coordinate expression:
$$
\tilde F = \psi \circ F \circ \varphi^{-1}
:
\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

Then:
$$
\boxed{
dF_p \;\text{is represented by}\; D\tilde F(\varphi(p))
}
$$

That is, **the Jacobian matrix is the coordinate representation of the differential**.

> The Jacobian depends on coordinates; the linear map $ dF_p $ does not.

---

### 1.3 Why this is not “just” the Jacobian

The Jacobian depends on coordinates;  
$ dF_p $ does not.

More precisely:

- $ dF_p $ is a **geometric linear map**
- The Jacobian is a **matrix representation** of that map in chosen bases:
  $$
  \frac{\partial \bigl(\psi^1 \circ F,\;\dots,\;\psi^n \circ F\bigr)}
      {\partial \bigl(x^1,\;\dots,\;x^m\bigr)}
  $$

If you change charts, the matrix changes by:

$$
\boxed{
J_{\text{new}} = D\psi\,\cdot\, J_{\text{old}} \,\cdot\, (D\varphi^{-1})
}
$$

but the underlying linear map $ dF_p $ stays the same.

## 2] Differential: alternative interpretation
### 2.1 Curve-based definition

This is also coordinate-free:

If  
$$
\gamma : (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \to M
$$
is a smooth curve with
$$
\gamma(0) = p
\quad \text{and} \quad
\gamma'(0) = v \in T_p M,
$$
then
$$
\boxed{
dF_p(v) = (F \circ \gamma)'(0) \in T_{F(p)} N.
}
$$

No coordinates anywhere. This viewpoint is often the most intuitive and is fully equivalent to the derivation definition.

---

### 2.2 Curves in local coordinates

Choose charts:

- $ (U,\varphi) $ on $ M $ with $ p \in U $
- $ (V,\psi) $ on $ N $ with $ F(p) \in V $

Define the coordinate representation:
$$
\tilde F := \psi \circ F \circ \varphi^{-1}
:
\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

Now define the coordinate curve:
$$
\tilde\gamma := \varphi \circ \gamma
:
(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \to \mathbb{R}^m.
$$

Consequently, in coordinates the statement is the following:

$$
\boxed{
D\tilde F(\varphi(p)) \cdot \tilde\gamma'(0) = 
D(\psi \circ F \circ \varphi^{-1})(\varphi(p))
\cdot
(\varphi \circ \gamma)'(0).
} 
$$

In the coordinate formula,
$$
\gamma'(0)
\quad \text{really means} \quad
\tilde\gamma'(0) =
(\varphi \circ \gamma)'(0).
$$

Here's a diagram that makes everything explicit

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_p M & \xrightarrow{dF_p} & T_{F(p)} N \\
\downarrow d\varphi_p & & \uparrow d\psi^{-1}_{\psi(F(p))} \\
\mathbb{R}^m & \xrightarrow{D\tilde F(\varphi(p))} & \mathbb{R}^n
\end{array}
$$

Thus:

- $ \gamma'(0) $ lives in $ T_p M $
- $ (\varphi \circ \gamma)'(0) = d\varphi_p(\gamma'(0)) \in \mathbb{R}^m $
- $ D\tilde F(\varphi(p)) $ acts on that coordinate vector

---

### 2.3 Sidenote: Graph Differential

The **graph** of $ F $ is
$$
\Gamma_F = \{ (p, F(p)) \mid p \in M \} \subset M \times N.
$$

Define the graph map:
$$
\Phi : M \to M \times N,
\quad
\Phi(p) = (p, F(p)).
$$

Its differential is:
$$
\boxed{
d\Phi_p(v) = (v, dF_p(v)).
}
$$

This is what is often called the **graph differential**.

## 3] Special Case: Maps Between Vector Spaces

### 3.1 A great simplification

If $ M = \mathbb{R}^m $, $ N = \mathbb{R}^n $, then:
$$
T_p M \cong \mathbb{R}^m,
\quad
T_{F(p)} N \cong \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

In this case:
- $ dF_p $ is a linear map $ \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n $
- Its matrix is exactly the **Jacobian matrix**
- $ dF_p(H) $ coincides with the **Fréchet / directional derivative**

---

### 3.2 Worked Example: $ F(A) = A^\top A $

Let
$$
F : \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \to \mathbb{R}^{n \times n},
\quad
F(A) = A^\top A.
$$

Since $ \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} $ is a vector space,
$$
T_A(\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}) \cong \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}.
$$

#### 3.2.1 Direct computation
There are several ways to compute the differential. The most straight-forward method is to do the following (as you might imagine):

For $ H \in T_A(\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}) $,
$$
dF_A(H) =
\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{0} (A+tH)^\top(A+tH).
$$

Expanding:
$$
(A+tH)^\top(A+tH) =
A^\top A + t(H^\top A + A^\top H) + t^2 H^\top H.
$$

Thus:
$$
\boxed{
dF_A(H) = H^\top A + A^\top H.
}
$$


#### 3.2.2 Curve-based computation

Let $ A(t) $ be a smooth curve with:
$$
A(0)=A,
\quad
A'(0)=H.
$$

Then:
$$
dF_A(H) =
\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{0} A(t)^\top A(t) =
H^\top A + A^\top H.
$$

This makes it clear that the definition of $dF_A(H)$ is __coordinate-free__.

Sidenote: if we restrict $A$ to symmetric or SPD matrices, what will we see? Or what if we connect this to Riemannian geometry on $GL(n)$ or $SPD(n)$? We'll come back to this later when we discuss Lie group and Lie algebra.
