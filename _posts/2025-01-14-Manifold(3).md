This is episode 3 on the smooth manifold series. Today we will be diving into the properties of maps between manifolds. I will first summarize how to understand and compute the differential of a smooth map between manifolds, both abstractly and concretely, culminating in the matrix-valued example  
$$
F(A) = A^\top A.
$$

---

## 1] Differential: canonical definition 
### 1.1 Differential of a Smooth Map (Intrinsic Definition)

Let
$$
F : M \to N
$$
be a smooth map between smooth manifolds.

For any point $ p \in M $, the **differential** is a linear map which is a __pushforward of derivations__. 
$$
dF_p : T_p M \longrightarrow T_{F(p)} N.
$$

### Derivation-based definition
If $ v \in T_p M $ is a tangent vector viewed as a derivation, then
$$
(dF_p v)(g) := v(g \circ F),
\qquad g \in C^\infty(N).
$$

This definition is **coordinate-free**.

It might appear at first both unnecessarily abstract and underestimated as to its computation. We might claim that it is essentially just a Jacobian matrix in local coordinates. However, the essence of this concept resides on its definition to be conceptually a coordinate-independent linear map between tangent spaces.

---

### 1.2 Coordinate Representation and the Jacobian

To compute $ dF_p $ in practice:

1. Choose a chart $ (U,\varphi) $ on $ M $ with $ p \in U $
2. Choose a chart $ (V,\psi) $ on $ N $ with $ F(p) \in V $

Define the coordinate expression:
$$
\tilde F = \psi \circ F \circ \varphi^{-1}
:
\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

Then:
$$
\boxed{
dF_p \;\text{is represented by}\; D\tilde F(\varphi(p))
}
$$

That is, **the Jacobian matrix is the coordinate representation of the differential**.

> The Jacobian depends on coordinates; the linear map $ dF_p $ does not.

---

### 1.3 Why this is not “just” the Jacobian

The Jacobian depends on coordinates;  
$ dF_p $ does not.

More precisely:

- $ dF_p $ is a **geometric linear map**
- The Jacobian is a **matrix representation** of that map in chosen bases:
  $$
  \frac{\partial \bigl(\psi^1 \circ F,\;\dots,\;\psi^n \circ F\bigr)}
      {\partial \bigl(x^1,\;\dots,\;x^m\bigr)}
  $$

If you change charts, the matrix changes by:

$$
\boxed{
J_{\text{new}} = D\psi\,\cdot\, J_{\text{old}} \,\cdot\, (D\varphi^{-1})
}
$$

but the underlying linear map $ dF_p $ stays the same.

---

## 2] Differential: alternative interpretation
### 2.1 Curve-based definition

This is also coordinate-free:

If  
$$
\gamma : (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \to M
$$
is a smooth curve with
$$
\gamma(0) = p
\quad \text{and} \quad
\gamma'(0) = v \in T_p M,
$$
then
$$
\boxed{
dF_p(v) = (F \circ \gamma)'(0) \in T_{F(p)} N.
}
$$

No coordinates anywhere. This viewpoint is often the most intuitive and is fully equivalent to the derivation definition.

---

### 2.2 Curves in local coordinates

Choose charts:

- $ (U,\varphi) $ on $ M $ with $ p \in U $
- $ (V,\psi) $ on $ N $ with $ F(p) \in V $

Define the coordinate representation:
$$
\tilde F := \psi \circ F \circ \varphi^{-1}
:
\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

Now define the coordinate curve:
$$
\tilde\gamma := \varphi \circ \gamma
:
(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \to \mathbb{R}^m.
$$

Consequently, in coordinates the statement is the following:

$$
\boxed{
D\tilde F(\varphi(p)) \cdot \tilde\gamma'(0) = 
D(\psi \circ F \circ \varphi^{-1})(\varphi(p))
\cdot
(\varphi \circ \gamma)'(0).
} 
$$

In the coordinate formula,
$$
\gamma'(0)
\quad \text{really means} \quad
\tilde\gamma'(0) =
(\varphi \circ \gamma)'(0).
$$

Here's a diagram that makes everything explicit

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
T_p M & \xrightarrow{dF_p} & T_{F(p)} N \\
\downarrow d\varphi_p & & \uparrow d\psi^{-1}_{\psi(F(p))} \\
\mathbb{R}^m & \xrightarrow{D\tilde F(\varphi(p))} & \mathbb{R}^n
\end{array}
$$

Thus:

- $ \gamma'(0) $ lives in $ T_p M $
- $ (\varphi \circ \gamma)'(0) = d\varphi_p(\gamma'(0)) \in \mathbb{R}^m $
- $ D\tilde F(\varphi(p)) $ acts on that coordinate vector

---

### 2.3 Sidenote: Graph Differential

The **graph** of $ F $ is
$$
\Gamma_F = \{ (p, F(p)) \mid p \in M \} \subset M \times N.
$$

Define the graph map:
$$
\Phi : M \to M \times N,
\quad
\Phi(p) = (p, F(p)).
$$

Its differential is:
$$
\boxed{
d\Phi_p(v) = (v, dF_p(v)).
}
$$

This is what is often called the **graph differential**.

---

## 3] Special Case: Maps Between Vector Spaces

### 3.1 A great simplification

If $ M = \mathbb{R}^m $, $ N = \mathbb{R}^n $, then:
$$
T_p M \cong \mathbb{R}^m,
\quad
T_{F(p)} N \cong \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

In this case:
- $ dF_p $ is a linear map $ \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n $
- Its matrix is exactly the **Jacobian matrix**
- $ dF_p(H) $ coincides with the **Fréchet / directional derivative**

---

### 3.2 Worked Example: $ F(A) = A^\top A $

Let
$$
F : \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \to \mathbb{R}^{n \times n},
\quad
F(A) = A^\top A.
$$

Since $ \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} $ is a vector space,
$$
T_A(\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}) \cong \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}.
$$

#### 3.2.1 Direct computation
There are several ways to compute the differential. The most straight-forward method is to do the following (as you might imagine):

For $ H \in T_A(\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}) $,
$$
dF_A(H) =
\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{0} (A+tH)^\top(A+tH).
$$

Expanding:
$$
(A+tH)^\top(A+tH) =
A^\top A + t(H^\top A + A^\top H) + t^2 H^\top H.
$$

Thus:
$$
\boxed{
dF_A(H) = H^\top A + A^\top H.
}
$$


#### 3.2.2 Curve-based computation

Let $ A(t) $ be a smooth curve with:
$$
A(0)=A,
\quad
A'(0)=H.
$$

Then:
$$
dF_A(H) =
\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{0} A(t)^\top A(t) =
H^\top A + A^\top H.
$$

This makes it clear that the definition of $dF_A(H)$ is __coordinate-free__.

Sidenote: if we restrict $A$ to symmetric or SPD matrices, what will we see? Or what if we connect this to Riemannian geometry on $GL(n)$ or $SPD(n)$? We'll come back to this later when we discuss Lie group and Lie algebra.

## 4] Back to classical regular surfaces (parametrizations, immersions)

### The Question in do Carmo DiffGeom

In do Carmo’s definition of a **regular surface** in $\mathbb{R}^3$, a coordinate map $X : U \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ is required to satisfy two conditions:

1. $X$ is a **differentiable homeomorphism** onto its image.
2. The differential $dX_p$ is **injective** at every point $p \in U$.

Since $X$ maps from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$, its differential can never be surjective, so injectivity (rank 2) is the meaningful requirement.

A natural question arises:

> If $X$ is already a differentiable homeomorphism, isn’t its differential automatically injective?

The answer is **no**.

Well, to make it explicit, let's figure out first what a differentiable homeomorphism actually gives us: If $X : U \to \mathbb{R}^3$ is a differentiable homeomorphism onto its image, then:

* $X$ is **continuous and injective**
* $X^{-1}$ is **continuous** (but *not* necessarily differentiable)
* Topologically, $X(U)$ looks like a 2‑dimensional surface

This is a **topological** statement plus differentiability of $X$. It controls *points*, but says nothing about what happens to *directions*. Crucially, differentiability of the inverse is *not* assumed.

Fine, but then why injectivity of the differential is not automatically assured? Notice that the differential

$
dX_p : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3
$

being injective means it has **rank 2** meaning no tangent direction is collapsed. A map can be:

* injective,
* continuous with continuous inverse,
* differentiable,

and *still* have rank drop somewhere. Let me give a concrete example:

Consider
$
X(u,v) = (u^3, v, 0).
$

Properties of this map:

* It is **injective**
* It is a **homeomorphism onto its image**
* It is differentiable everywhere

However, its differential is
$
dX_{(u,v)} =
\begin{pmatrix}
3u^2 & 0 \
0 & 1 \
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$

At $u = 0$, this matrix has **rank 1**, not 2. One tangent direction is squashed. Therefore, this map is **not an immersion**, and it does **not** define a regular surface in do Carmo’s sense.

---

However, you might observe here a seemingly apparent paradox: “But the image is **Just** a plane!”

Well, the image of
$
X(u,v) = (u^3, v, 0)
$
is
$
{(x,y,0) : x,y \in \mathbb{R}},
$
which is the entire (xy)-plane indeed. As a **subset** of $\mathbb{R}^3$, this plane is perfectly flat, so one might expect its tangent plane at every point to be the whole plane. So then why does the tangent collapse under this map?

---

The key point here is that here are **two distinct notions** at play:

1. The tangent plane of a **subset** of (\mathbb{R}^3)
2. The tangent plane **defined by a parametrization**

In do Carmo’s approach, tangent planes are defined *via parametrizations*. The tangent plane at a point is
$
T_pS = \operatorname{span}{X_u(p), X_v(p)}.
$

For the map above:
$
X_u = (3u^2, 0, 0), \quad X_v = (0,1,0).
$

At (u=0):
$
X_u(0,v) = (0,0,0), \quad X_v(0,v) = (0,1,0),
$
so the span is **1‑dimensional**.

This means:

> The parametrization fails to distinguish two independent directions in the parameter domain.

Geometrically, the $u$-direction has been crushed.

---

But does the plane still have a 2D tangent plane?

Yes — but **not via this parametrization**.

If instead we parametrize the same plane by
$
Y(s,t) = (s,t,0),
$
then
$
dY =
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \
0 & 1 \
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix},
$
which has rank 2 everywhere.

So the *same subset* becomes a **regular surface** under a different map.

---
Finally, what does this meana conceptually? The key lesson is:

> **Regularity is not a property of the subset alone — it is a property of the subset together with its smooth structure.**

Different parametrizations can induce:

* a **good** smooth structure (immersion)
* or a **bad** one (rank collapse)

This is why do Carmo requires that **there exists** a local parametrization with injective differential.

---

In other words, if you ask “Does that mean there might exist other maps which make the plane a regular surface?”, then the answer is Yes — absolutely. The plane *is* a regular surface because such maps exist.

Behind that is another question: “Does immersion entirely depend on which maps we pick?” Yes!

* **Immersion is a property of the map**, not of the set.
* A **regular surface** is a set for which *good immersions exist everywhere*.

In this seense, do Carmo does separate the conditions, being deliberately modular:

1. **Homeomorphism** → good topology (no self‑intersections)
2. **Injective differential** → good differential geometry

whether neither condition implies the other.

Finally, some of key points:

* The same subset of (\mathbb{R}^3) can support **many different smooth structures**
* Differential geometry only works once a smooth structure is fixed
* Parametrizations are how do Carmo *builds* that structure

This is why modern texts often say:

> “A surface is a 2‑dimensional smooth manifold embedded in (\mathbb{R}^3).”

Do Carmo reaches this notion **from parametrizations upward**, rather than assuming it at the start.

---


> **Topology sees points.**
> **Differential geometry sees directions.**

A homeomorphism controls points.
Injectivity of the differential controls directions.

You need **both** to get a regular surface.















## 5] Association with inverse function theorem


## 6] Immersion, submersion
Immersion basics

Here I want to emphasize one key fact that:

> immersion imply a nonzero determinant in coordinates

Why? Again, let's recall that immersion means the differential is injective
Let  
$$
\phi:M^m\to N^n,\qquad m\le n
$$
and let $p\in M$.  
Saying **\(\phi\) is an immersion at \(p\)** means the differential
$$
d\phi_p:T_pM\to T_{\phi(p)}N
$$
is **injective**.

Equivalently (in linear algebra language):  
$$
\operatorname{rank}(d\phi_p)=m.
$$

Now, if write it in local coordinates → Jacobian matrix has rank \(m\)
Pick coordinate charts:

- on $M$: $x=(x^1,\dots,x^m)$ around $p$
- on $N$: $y=(y^1,\dots,y^n)$ around $\phi(p)$

Then locally $\phi$ looks like a smooth map between Euclidean spaces:
$$
y^a = \phi^a(x^1,\dots,x^m),\qquad a=1,\dots,n.
$$

Its differential in these coordinates is represented by the **Jacobian matrix**
$$
J(p)=\left(\frac{\partial \phi^a}{\partial x^i}(p)\right)
$$
which is an \(n\times m\) matrix.

The immersion condition says:
$$
\operatorname{rank}(J(p))=m.
$$

So the columns of $J(p)$ are linearly independent.

Now we use a standard linear algebra fact:

> An $n\times m$ matrix has rank $m$ **iff** there exists an $m\times m$ submatrix (choose $m$ rows) whose determinant is nonzero.

Why?

- If **every** $m\times m$ minor determinant were zero, then **every** set of $m$ rows would be linearly dependent, so the rank would be $<m$.
- Since the rank is $m$, at least one choice of $m$ rows gives an invertible $m\times m$ matrix.

Concretely: there exist indices
$$
1\le a_1<\cdots<a_m\le n
$$
such that the matrix
$$
\left(\frac{\partial \phi^{a_\alpha}}{\partial x^i}(p)\right)_{\alpha,i}
$$
has
$$
\det\left(\frac{\partial \phi^{a_\alpha}}{\partial x^i}(p)\right)\neq 0.
$$

If we now **rename/reorder the target coordinates** so that those special indices become $1,\dots,m$, then we can assume:

$$
\det\left(\frac{\partial (\phi^1,\dots,\phi^m)}{\partial (x^1,\dots,x^m)}(p)\right)\neq 0.
$$

That’s exactly the statement: in coordinates (after renumbering if needed), an immersion gives a nonzero determinant of an \(m\times m\) Jacobian block.

In one line summary: an immersion means $\phi$ “doesn’t collapse any tangent directions,” so locally you can find $m$ coordinate functions of $\phi$ that vary independently — and “vary independently” is exactly “Jacobian block has nonzero determinant.”

---
#### Side note: Connection to the Constant Rank Theorem / local normal form of an immersion?

Remember that Constant Rank Theorem (specialized to immersions) says:
Let $\phi:M^m\to N^n$ be smooth, and suppose $\phi$ is an **immersion at $p$**.  
That means
$$
\operatorname{rank}(d\phi_p)=m.
$$

Then the constant rank theorem says:

> There exist coordinate charts  
> $$
> (U,x)\ \text{around }p,\qquad (V,y)\ \text{around }\phi(p)
> $$
> such that in these coordinates the map becomes
> $$
> y\circ \phi\circ x^{-1}(u^1,\dots,u^m)
> \;=\;
> (u^1,\dots,u^m,0,\dots,0).
> $$

So locally, $\phi$ looks like the **standard inclusion**
$$
\mathbb{R}^m \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n,\qquad u\mapsto (u,0).
$$

That is the precise geometric meaning of “immersion.”

In these special coordinates,
$$
\phi^1(u)=u^1,\;\dots,\;\phi^m(u)=u^m,\qquad 
\phi^{m+1}(u)=0,\dots,\phi^n(u)=0.
$$

So the Jacobian matrix is literally
$$
J=
\begin{pmatrix}
I_m\\
0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
(an $n\times m$ matrix).

Now look at the top $m\times m$ block:
$$
\frac{\partial(\phi^1,\dots,\phi^m)}{\partial(u^1,\dots,u^m)} = I_m,
$$
so
$$
\det(I_m)=1\neq 0.
$$

That’s exactly the coordinate statement.

How this matches the “minor is nonzero” argument? Before using the constant rank theorem, we only know:

- $J(p)$ has rank $m$
- therefore some $m\times m$ minor determinant is nonzero

Then the constant rank theorem tells us that we can actually **choose coordinates** so that the “good minor” becomes the *first* $m$ coordinates, and the map becomes $(u,0)$.

So:

- **Linear algebra fact:** full rank $\Rightarrow$ some minor $\neq 0$
- **Constant rank theorem:** we can change coordinates to make that minor the obvious identity matrix.

The geometric picture (why $(u,0)$ is the right normal form) is that an immersion means $\phi$ “injects tangent vectors,” so locally $\phi(U)\subset N$ is an $m-dimensional “sheet” sitting inside an n-dimensional space. In good coordinates on N, that sheet looks like:

$$
\{(y^1,\dots,y^n): y^{m+1}=\cdots=y^n=0\},
$$

i.e. an embedded copy of $\mathbb{R}^m\$.

So locally, $\phi$ is just a parametrization of that sheet.
