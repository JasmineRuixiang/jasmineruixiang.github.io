Explain and compare multiple equivalences from differential geometry and topology, including homeomorphism, diffeomorphism, homotopy equivalence, homomorphism, isomorphism, etc.

Invariant and equivariant functions (CNN is equivariant). 

Also discussions on cardinality among sets (including finite and infinite (countably infinite $$N0$$? and uncountably infinite), Hillbert Hotel problem, equipotent sets)
