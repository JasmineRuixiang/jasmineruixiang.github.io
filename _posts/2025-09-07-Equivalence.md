Explain and compare multiple equivalences from differential geometry and topology, including homeomorphism, diffeomorphism, homotopy equivalence, homomorphism, isomorphism, etc.

Also discussions on cardinality among sets (including finite and infinite (countably infinite $$N0$$? and uncountably infinite), Hillbert Hotel problem, equipotent sets)
