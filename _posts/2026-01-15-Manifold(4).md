This is episode 4 on the smooth manifold series. Today we will be exploring more on tangent vectors, and another key concept related to tangent spaces for different tangent planes: connections. 

## Intuition: Directional Derivatives


🌐 The Connection: Bridging Derivatives from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to Curved Manifolds
The concept of a connection is the necessary tool that allows us to perform differential calculus on curved spaces (manifolds), such as the surface of a sphere. It generalizes the familiar idea of the directional derivative from flat Euclidean space ($\mathbb{R}^3$).
1. Directional Derivatives in Euclidean Space ($\mathbb{R}^3$)
In $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$, the directional derivative provides a simple way to measure change. The basis vectors $\left\{ \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k} \right\}$ (or the equivalent operators $\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right\}$) are constant, allowing us to define derivatives simply as component-wise partial derivatives.
Let $p=(1, 2, 0)$ be a point, $X=(y, -x, 3x)$ be the direction vector field, and $V=(xz, y^2, -2x)$ be a vector field.
A. Derivative of a Scalar Function ($D_X f$)
This is the directional derivative of a smooth scalar function $f$ in the direction $X$.

Perspective
Formula
Example Result for f(x,y,z)=xy2+z at p
Vector-Based (Calculus)
$D_X f = \nabla f \cdot X$
$D_X f(p) = \langle 4, 4, 1 \rangle \cdot \langle 2, -1, 3 \rangle = \mathbf{7}$
Point Derivation (Geometry)
$X[f] = X^i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}$
$Xf = (y^3 - 2x^2y + 3x)\big

This confirms that in differential geometry, a tangent vector $X$ is rigorously defined as a point derivation—an operator that mimics the directional derivative by satisfying the Leibniz rule.
B. Derivative of a Vector Field ($D_X V$)
This derivative measures how the vector field $V$ changes as we move in the direction $X$. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, this is calculated by taking the directional derivative of each component of $V$.
Using the vector fields $X$ and $V$:
The $k$-th component of the resulting vector $D_X V$ is $(D_X V)^k = \sum_{i} X^i \frac{\partial V^k}{\partial x^i}$.
Component 1 (i.e., $k=1$): $(D_X V)^1 = yz + 3x^2$
Component 2 (i.e., $k=2$): $(D_X V)^2 = -2xy$
Component 3 (i.e., $k=3$): $(D_X V)^3 = -2y$
Evaluating at $p=(1, 2, 0)$ gives:


$$D_X V(p) = \langle 3, -4, -4 \rangle$$
2. The General Connection: The Covariant Derivative ($\nabla_X V$)
The formula for $D_X V$ fails on a curved manifold $M$ because the tangent spaces $T_p M$ and $T_q M$ at nearby points $p$ and $q$ are distinct. We cannot simply subtract the vector $V(p)$ from $V(q)$.
A Connection ($\nabla$) is the rule that provides the necessary "correction" to define the derivative intrinsically on $M$. The resulting derivative is called the covariant derivative $\nabla_X V$.
A. Definition and Axioms
The connection is an operator $\nabla: C^{\infty}(M) \times C^{\infty}(M) \to C^{\infty}(M)$ that maps two vector fields, $X$ and $V$, to a new vector field $\nabla_X V$, satisfying:
Linearity over Functions in $X$: $\nabla_{fX} V = f \nabla_X V$
Linearity in $V$: $\nabla_X (aV + bW) = a \nabla_X V + b \nabla_X W$
Leibniz Rule: $\nabla_X (fV) = (Xf) V + f \nabla_X V$ (where $Xf$ is the directional derivative of $f$)
B. The Coordinate Form and Christoffel Symbols
In local coordinates, the covariant derivative $\nabla_X V$ is defined using the Christoffel symbols ($\Gamma^k_{ij}$), which represent the rate of change of the coordinate basis vectors $\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right\}$:

$$(\nabla_X V)^k = \underbrace{X^i \frac{\partial V^k}{\partial x^i}}_{\text{I. Flat-Space Derivative Term}} + \underbrace{X^i \Gamma^k_{ij} V^j}_{\text{II. Curvature Correction Term}}$$
The Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are defined by the action of the connection on the basis vectors:


$$\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} = \sum_{k} \Gamma^k_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}$$
Difference from Euclidean Case: In $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Cartesian coordinates, $\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$, and the second term vanishes, resulting in $\nabla_X V = D_X V$. On a curved manifold, $\Gamma^k_{ij} \neq 0$, and the correction term is essential.
3. The Levi-Civita Connection
In Riemannian Geometry, a Riemannian metric $g$ is introduced to measure lengths and angles.
The Levi-Civita Connection is the unique connection that respects this metric structure. It is defined by two crucial properties:
Metric Compatibility: The connection must preserve the metric $g$ under parallel transport.

$$X(g(V, W)) = g(\nabla_X V, W) + g(V, \nabla_X W)$$
Zero Torsion: The connection must satisfy:

$$\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X = [X, Y]$$

where $[X, Y]$ is the Lie bracket.
The Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita Connection are thus entirely determined by the components of the metric $g_{ij}$ and their first derivatives:

$$\Gamma^k_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} g^{k\ell} \left( \frac{\partial g_{j\ell}}{\partial x^i} + \frac{\partial g_{i\ell}}{\partial x^j} - \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^\ell} \right)$$

## 0] Introduction

## 1] Why Do We Need a Connection?
In Euclidean space $$\mathbb{R}^{n}$$, if we have a vector field
$$Y(x) = (Y^1(x), \cdots, Y^n(x))$$, and we could easily differentiate component-wise: $$\frac{\partial Y^i}{\partial x^j}$$. This works because

- All tangent spaces are the same vector space.
- We can subtract vectors at different points.
- We can differentiate vector fields componentwise.

But on a manifold:

- A vector field satisfies  
  $$V(p) \in T_pM$$
  $$V(q) \in T_qM$$
- These live in _different_ vector spaces.
- Subtracting them directly makes no sense.

So we need a rule that tells us:

> How does a vector field $$Y$$ change as we move in a given direction given by $$X$$?

This rule is an **affine connection**. And we __choose__ such a rule. 

---

## 2] Definition of an Affine Connection

A connection $$\nabla$$ assigns to vector fields X and Y a new vector field: $$\nabla_X Y$$

We could think of it as:

> The derivative of $$Y$$ in the direction $$X$$.

This specified choice needs to satisfy the following three rules:

* Linearity in $$X$$
$$
\nabla_{fX + gZ} Y = f\nabla_X Y + g\nabla_Z Y
$$

* Linearity in $$Y$$
$$
\nabla_X (Y + Z) = \nabla_X Y + \nabla_X Z
$$

* __Leibniz Rule__
$$
\nabla_X (fY) = X(f)Y + f\nabla_X Y
$$

This last property is crucial, as it mirrors ordinary differentiation (notice that we also require the definition of derivation when in tangent vector to also satisfy the Leibniz rule).

Also note that this definition does **not** require a metric.

---

## 3] Local Coordinate Formula and Christoffel Symbols

Choose coordinates $$(x^1, \dots, x^n)$$ first. 

Let  
$$
X_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
$$

Define:

$$
\nabla_{X_i} X_j = \Gamma^k_{ij} X_k
$$

(Or, just in another format, to be crystal clear)

$$
\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} = \sum_{k = 1}^n \Gamma^k_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}
$$

We use above the Einstein summation notation as convention (to simplify notations). In below, whenever summation might be obvious I will drop it. Here the $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are called the **Christoffel symbols**, which tell us how the coordinate basis vectors change as we move.

Now use the above notation, say for two vector fields:

$$
X = X^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
$$
$$
Y = Y^j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}
$$

We could obtain:

$$
\boxed{
\nabla_X Y
= \left(
X^i \frac{\partial Y^k}{\partial x^i}
+
X^i \Gamma^k_{ij} Y^j
\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial{x^k}}
}
$$


This will be our main formula. If we stair at it for a bit, the following should be intuitive:

- First term: change in components, what we shall expect in Euclidean space. It measures how the components of $$Y$$ change. If the manifold were flat and the basis vectors didn’t vary, this would be enough. 
- Second term: correction for changes in basis, because on a curved manifold, the basis vectors $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}$$ change from point to point. So even if the components $$Y^j$$ stay constant, the vector field itself might change because the basis is rotating or stretching. This change is captured by the second term including the Christoffel symbols, which measure how the coordinate frame twists and turns.

Consequently, covariant derivative is basically the combination of component change and basis change.

## 4] A Short Reflection

Based on the above definition, what is an affine connection conceptually? Well, an affine connection gives us a way to compare vectors at nearby points, which later will turn out to be our abilities to define 

* 1] a notion of parallel transport
* 2] a notion of geodesics
* 3] a notion of curvature

It is the structure that tells us how to move vectors around on a manifold. Without it, differentiation makes no sense.  

You may also ask why it is called "affine connection". That's because it preserves affine combinations: If a vector is transported parallelly, it behaves like in affine geometry — no metric required.

Let me reinforce the idea that at this stage, no Riemannian metric at all is assumed. The definition of connection has nothing to do with any metric (we will see shortly that in some sense we do need to marry these two notions in a nice way; if this is your intuition, keep immersing yourself in it).

---

## 5] Covariant Derivative Along a Curve

In many scenarios, we are interested in how a vector field "changes" on a specific trajectory. With an affine connection defined as above, how could we calculate such change?

Given a curve $$\alpha(t)$$ and vector field along the curve: $$V(t) \in T_{\alpha(t)}M$$. Again, the ordinary derivative $\frac{dV}{dt}$ makes no sense because:

$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{V(t + h) - V(t)}{h}
$$

but $$V(t+v) \in T_{\alpha(t+h)}M$$, $$V(t) \in T_{\alpha(t)}M$$, and subtraction requires vectors to live in the same space.

To resolve this conflict and apply the defined connection, we define:

$$
\frac{DV}{dt} = \nabla_{\alpha'(t)} V
$$

where $$\alpha'(t) = \frac{d\alpha}{dt} \in T_{\alpha(t)}M$$.

which is called the `covariant derivative`. In other words, the covariant derivative along a curve is just the affine connection applied in the direction of the velocity vector. It’s not new machinery — it’s just the connection specialized to a curve.

In coordinates, if we write $$V(t) = V^k(t)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}$$:

$$
\frac{DV^k}{dt}
= (\frac{dV^k}{dt}
+
\Gamma^k_{ij}
\frac{dx^i}{dt}
V^j)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}
$$

This is just the previous formula about coordinate representation of connections if we replace $$X = \alpha'(t)$$. Consequently, we could carry the same interpretation: Covariant derivative = change in components+change in basis. 

We could interpret it this way: Imagine walking on a sphere. We carry an arrow that we try to keep “pointing in the same direction.” Even if the arrow looks constant to you, from an external viewpoint it may be rotating because:

> The tangent plane itself rotates as you move.

> The coordinate basis changes.

So $$\frac{D V}{dt}$$ actually measures the true rate of change of the vector relative to the manifold’s geometry. There are two kinds of change: 1)Intrinsic change — the vector itself changes' 2) Fake change — the coordinate frame changes. But $$\frac{D V}{dt}$$ removes the fake change. It measures intrinsic change.

## 6] Parallel Transport

If:

$$
\frac{DV}{dt} = 0
$$

Then $V$ is **parallel transported**.

Parallel transport is obtained by solving the ODE:

$$
\frac{dV^k}{dt}
+
\Gamma^k_{ij}
\frac{dx^i}{dt}V^j
= 0
$$

Pointwise Christoffel data determines global comparison via integration.

Local rule → differential equation → global comparison.

---

# 6. Geodesics

A curve is a geodesic if:

$$
\frac{D\alpha'}{dt} = 0
$$

Meaning:

> The velocity vector transports itself parallelly.

Geodesics generalize straight lines.

---

# 7. Infinite Choices of Connections

There are infinitely many connections.

If $\nabla$ is a connection and $A$ is a $(1,2)$-tensor:

$$
\widetilde{\nabla}_X Y = \nabla_X Y + A(X,Y)
$$

is another connection.

The space of connections is affine.

---

# 8. Metric Compatibility

Condition:

$$
X \langle Y,Z \rangle
=
\langle \nabla_X Y, Z \rangle
+
\langle Y, \nabla_X Z \rangle
$$

Equivalent to:

$$
\nabla g = 0
$$

Meaning:

Parallel transport preserves:

- Length
- Angles
- Inner products

Interpretation:

> The connection moves vectors without distorting measurement.

Metric compatibility controls stretching.

---

# 9. Torsion-Free (Symmetry)

Torsion tensor:

$$
T(X,Y)
=
\nabla_X Y
-
\nabla_Y X
-
[X,Y]
$$

If $T = 0$:

$$
\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X = [X,Y]
$$

Geometric meaning:

- No artificial twisting.
- Infinitesimal parallelograms close.
- Connection respects intrinsic commutation of flows.

In coordinates:

$$
\Gamma^k_{ij} = \Gamma^k_{ji}
$$

Torsion-free controls twisting.

---

# 10. Levi-Civita Connection

Imposing:

1. Metric compatibility
2. Torsion-free

There exists exactly one such connection.

This is the **Levi-Civita connection**.

It removes stretching and twisting.

Only curvature remains.

---

# 11. Lie Brackets of Coordinate Vector Fields

For coordinate fields:

$$
X_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
$$

We always have:

$$
[X_i, X_j] = 0
$$

This is independent of connection.

Torsion-free does not force Lie bracket to vanish.

It ensures the connection respects the bracket structure:

$$
\nabla_{X_i}X_j - \nabla_{X_j}X_i = [X_i,X_j]
$$

---

# 12. Why Christoffel Symbols Are Defined Pointwise

Concern:

Connection compares vectors at different points,
yet $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are defined at one point.

Resolution:

A connection describes infinitesimal change.

Just like:

$$
f(b) - f(a) = \int_a^b f'(t)\,dt
$$

Christoffel symbols encode infinitesimal twisting of the frame.

Solving the parallel transport ODE gives comparison between points.

Local data → differential equation → global transport.

---

# 13. Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Derivative

If $M \subset \mathbb{R}^n$:

You can compute ambient derivative $\frac{dV}{dt}$.

But generally:

$$
\frac{dV}{dt} \notin T_{\alpha(t)}M
$$

It has a normal component.

Projecting back to tangent space gives intrinsic derivative.

However:

- Different embeddings give different projections.
- Intrinsic geometry should not depend on embedding.

Connections defined intrinsically avoid embedding dependence.

---

# 14. What Is a Manifold?

A smooth manifold is:

- An abstract set of points
- With smooth coordinate charts

No built-in:

- Length
- Angles
- Curvature

Shape appears only after adding structure.

---

# 15. Structural Hierarchy

Smooth structure → calculus  
Connection → differentiation  
Metric → measurement  
Curvature → failure of parallel transport to commute  

Connections exist without metrics.

Metrics are additional structure.

---

# 16. Why Connections Exist Without Metrics

Differentiation requires:

- Smooth structure
- Rule comparing tangent spaces infinitesimally

It does not require:

- Inner product
- Length
- Angle

Connections are about motion of vectors.

Metrics are about measurement.

---

# 17. Embedding Is Not Essential

Manifolds need not be embedded.

Geometry should not depend on ambient space.

Intrinsic geometry depends only on internal structures:

- Connection
- Metric

---

# 18. Final Synthesis

Connection:
> Infinitesimal rule for comparing tangent spaces.

Christoffel symbols:
> Local coefficients describing how frames twist.

Metric compatibility:
> No stretching under transport.

Torsion-free:
> No artificial twisting.

Levi-Civita:
> Unique natural connection for a Riemannian metric.

Intrinsic geometry:
> Independent of embedding.

---

# One-Sentence Summary

A connection encodes infinitesimal comparison of tangent spaces;  
metric compatibility preserves lengths and angles;  
torsion-free removes artificial twisting;  
and from these local rules, global geometry emerges.
