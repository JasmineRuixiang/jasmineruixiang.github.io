This is episode 4 on the smooth manifold series. Today we will be exploring more on tangent vectors, and another key concept related to tangent spaces for different tangent planes: connections. 

## Intuition: Directional Derivatives


🌐 The Connection: Bridging Derivatives from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to Curved Manifolds
The concept of a connection is the necessary tool that allows us to perform differential calculus on curved spaces (manifolds), such as the surface of a sphere. It generalizes the familiar idea of the directional derivative from flat Euclidean space ($\mathbb{R}^3$).
1. Directional Derivatives in Euclidean Space ($\mathbb{R}^3$)
In $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$, the directional derivative provides a simple way to measure change. The basis vectors $\left\{ \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j}, \mathbf{k} \right\}$ (or the equivalent operators $\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right\}$) are constant, allowing us to define derivatives simply as component-wise partial derivatives.
Let $p=(1, 2, 0)$ be a point, $X=(y, -x, 3x)$ be the direction vector field, and $V=(xz, y^2, -2x)$ be a vector field.
A. Derivative of a Scalar Function ($D_X f$)
This is the directional derivative of a smooth scalar function $f$ in the direction $X$.

Perspective
Formula
Example Result for f(x,y,z)=xy2+z at p
Vector-Based (Calculus)
$D_X f = \nabla f \cdot X$
$D_X f(p) = \langle 4, 4, 1 \rangle \cdot \langle 2, -1, 3 \rangle = \mathbf{7}$
Point Derivation (Geometry)
$X[f] = X^i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}$
$Xf = (y^3 - 2x^2y + 3x)\big

This confirms that in differential geometry, a tangent vector $X$ is rigorously defined as a point derivation—an operator that mimics the directional derivative by satisfying the Leibniz rule.
B. Derivative of a Vector Field ($D_X V$)
This derivative measures how the vector field $V$ changes as we move in the direction $X$. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, this is calculated by taking the directional derivative of each component of $V$.
Using the vector fields $X$ and $V$:
The $k$-th component of the resulting vector $D_X V$ is $(D_X V)^k = \sum_{i} X^i \frac{\partial V^k}{\partial x^i}$.
Component 1 (i.e., $k=1$): $(D_X V)^1 = yz + 3x^2$
Component 2 (i.e., $k=2$): $(D_X V)^2 = -2xy$
Component 3 (i.e., $k=3$): $(D_X V)^3 = -2y$
Evaluating at $p=(1, 2, 0)$ gives:


$$D_X V(p) = \langle 3, -4, -4 \rangle$$
2. The General Connection: The Covariant Derivative ($\nabla_X V$)
The formula for $D_X V$ fails on a curved manifold $M$ because the tangent spaces $T_p M$ and $T_q M$ at nearby points $p$ and $q$ are distinct. We cannot simply subtract the vector $V(p)$ from $V(q)$.
A Connection ($\nabla$) is the rule that provides the necessary "correction" to define the derivative intrinsically on $M$. The resulting derivative is called the covariant derivative $\nabla_X V$.
A. Definition and Axioms
The connection is an operator $\nabla: C^{\infty}(M) \times C^{\infty}(M) \to C^{\infty}(M)$ that maps two vector fields, $X$ and $V$, to a new vector field $\nabla_X V$, satisfying:
Linearity over Functions in $X$: $\nabla_{fX} V = f \nabla_X V$
Linearity in $V$: $\nabla_X (aV + bW) = a \nabla_X V + b \nabla_X W$
Leibniz Rule: $\nabla_X (fV) = (Xf) V + f \nabla_X V$ (where $Xf$ is the directional derivative of $f$)
B. The Coordinate Form and Christoffel Symbols
In local coordinates, the covariant derivative $\nabla_X V$ is defined using the Christoffel symbols ($\Gamma^k_{ij}$), which represent the rate of change of the coordinate basis vectors $\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} \right\}$:

$$(\nabla_X V)^k = \underbrace{X^i \frac{\partial V^k}{\partial x^i}}_{\text{I. Flat-Space Derivative Term}} + \underbrace{X^i \Gamma^k_{ij} V^j}_{\text{II. Curvature Correction Term}}$$
The Christoffel symbols $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are defined by the action of the connection on the basis vectors:


$$\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} = \sum_{k} \Gamma^k_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}$$
Difference from Euclidean Case: In $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Cartesian coordinates, $\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$, and the second term vanishes, resulting in $\nabla_X V = D_X V$. On a curved manifold, $\Gamma^k_{ij} \neq 0$, and the correction term is essential.
3. The Levi-Civita Connection
In Riemannian Geometry, a Riemannian metric $g$ is introduced to measure lengths and angles.
The Levi-Civita Connection is the unique connection that respects this metric structure. It is defined by two crucial properties:
Metric Compatibility: The connection must preserve the metric $g$ under parallel transport.

$$X(g(V, W)) = g(\nabla_X V, W) + g(V, \nabla_X W)$$
Zero Torsion: The connection must satisfy:

$$\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X = [X, Y]$$

where $[X, Y]$ is the Lie bracket.
The Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita Connection are thus entirely determined by the components of the metric $g_{ij}$ and their first derivatives:

$$\Gamma^k_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} g^{k\ell} \left( \frac{\partial g_{j\ell}}{\partial x^i} + \frac{\partial g_{i\ell}}{\partial x^j} - \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^\ell} \right)$$
